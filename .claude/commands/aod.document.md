## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

Consider user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Overview

Post-delivery quality review for the completed feature. This is Stage 6 of the AOD
lifecycle — the one stage designed for human judgment. Each step presents findings
interactively and commits only what the human approves.

**Flow**: Validate context → Branch → Code simplification → Docs-lint → CHANGELOG → API sync → KB review → PR squash-merge → Report

## Step 0: Validate Context

1. Get branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. Determine feature number NNN:
   - If on a `NNN-*` branch: extract NNN from branch name
   - If on `main`: extract NNN from user input `$ARGUMENTS`, or detect from most recent `feat(NNN)` or `docs(NNN)` commit on main
   - If NNN cannot be determined: prompt the user for the feature number
3. Find tasks: `specs/{NNN}-*/tasks.md` → verify all tasks marked `[X]` (build complete)
4. If tasks incomplete: warn "Build may not be complete — {incomplete_count} tasks remain" and ask whether to proceed
5. Display: "Document stage for Feature {NNN}"

## Step 0b: Create Document Branch

1. If not already on main: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
2. Create branch: `git checkout -b {NNN}-document-stage`
3. Display: "Working on branch {NNN}-document-stage"

## Step 1: Code Simplification

Detect changed code files and run /simplify for human review.

### 1a: Detect Changed Files

1. Run: `git diff --name-only main...HEAD`
2. Filter to code extensions: `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.sh`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.java`, `.rb`, `.swift`, `.kt`
3. Exclude: `*.lock`, `*.min.js`, `*.min.css`, `*.map`, `*.generated.*`, `vendor/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `node_modules/`, `.aod/`, `docs/`
4. Store as `changed_files` list and `file_count`
5. If `file_count` is 0: display "No code files changed — skipping simplification", proceed to Step 2
6. If `file_count` > 50: warn "Large diff ({file_count} files). Simplify may take several minutes." and ask whether to continue or skip

### 1b: Run Simplification

1. Record pre-invocation file states: `git diff --name-only`
2. Invoke `/simplify` skill via Skill tool
3. If skill fails: display error, ask (A) Retry, (B) Skip, (C) Abort

### 1c: Review Results

1. Detect modified files: `git diff --name-only`
2. If no files modified: display "No simplification changes — code looks good", proceed to Step 2
3. Get diff stats: `git diff --stat`
4. Present summary via AskUserQuestion:
   ```
   Code Simplification Review:
     Files reviewed: {file_count}
     Files modified: {modified_count}
     Changes: +{insertions} -{deletions} lines

     {one-line summary per modified file}

   Options:
     (A) Accept all — commit as refactor({NNN}): simplify
     (B) Reject all — revert and continue
     (C) Abort
   ```
5. Accept: stage and commit with `refactor({NNN}): simplify code per /simplify review`
6. Reject: revert modified files with `git checkout -- {files}`

## Step 2: Docs-Lint

Analyze changed code for undocumented complex functions and suggest docstrings.

### 2a: Analyze Complexity

1. Use the `changed_files` list from Step 1a (re-detect if Step 1 was skipped)
2. Filter to supported languages: `.py`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.java`
3. For each file, identify functions/methods and count branch statements (if, else, for, while, match, switch, case)
4. Flag functions where: complexity >= 3 AND no existing docstring
5. If no functions flagged: display "All complex functions are documented", proceed to Step 3

### 2b: Present Docstring Suggestions

1. For each flagged function, generate a docstring matching the file's existing style
2. Present via AskUserQuestion:
   ```
   Docs-Lint Review:
     Files analyzed: {file_count}
     Functions flagged: {flagged_count}

     {list each: file:line — function_name (complexity: N)}

   Options:
     (A) Accept all suggested docstrings
     (B) Skip all
     (C) Review individually
   ```
3. If accepted: apply docstrings, stage, commit with `docs({NNN}): add docstrings per docs-lint`

## Step 3: CHANGELOG Generation

Generate CHANGELOG entries from the feature's delivery commits on main (not the document branch).

### 3a: Collect and Categorize Commits

1. Run: `git log --format="%H %s" main` and filter to commits matching `(NNN)` or the feature name from `specs/{NNN}-*/`
2. If no relevant commits found: display "No commits found", proceed to Step 4
3. If `CHANGELOG.md` exists: read it and exclude commits whose SHA (first 7 chars) already appear
4. If all commits already captured: display "CHANGELOG is up to date", proceed to Step 4
5. Parse conventional commit prefixes:
   - `feat:` → **Added**
   - `fix:` → **Fixed**
   - `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `style:`, `perf:`, `test:` → **Changed**
   - Contains "remove"/"delete"/"drop" → **Removed**
   - Others → **Other**

### 3b: Generate and Review

1. Build markdown section: `### Feature {NNN}`
2. List entries by category with short SHA
3. Create `CHANGELOG.md` if missing (Keep a Changelog format)
4. Present via AskUserQuestion:
   ```
   CHANGELOG Preview:
     New entries: {count}
     Categories: {list}

   (A) Accept and commit
   (B) Skip
   ```
5. If accepted: insert under `## [Unreleased]`, stage, commit with `docs({NNN}): update CHANGELOG`

## Step 4: API Documentation Sync

Compare code endpoints against OpenAPI spec and flag mismatches.

### 4a: Discover Spec and Changed Endpoints

1. Search for OpenAPI spec: `openapi.yaml`, `openapi.json`, `swagger.yaml`, `swagger.json` in root, `docs/`, `api/`, `spec/`
2. If no spec found: display "No OpenAPI spec found — skipping", proceed to Step 5
3. Get changed files: `git diff --name-only main...HEAD`
4. Filter to API-relevant extensions: `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.go`, `.java`, `.rb`
5. Scan for framework endpoint patterns (FastAPI, Express, Flask decorators)
6. If no endpoints in changed files: display "No API endpoints changed", proceed to Step 5

### 4b: Compare and Report

1. Extract endpoint signatures from code (method, path, params, response type)
2. Parse OpenAPI spec for corresponding definitions
3. Identify mismatches: new endpoints, changed params, removed endpoints, response type diffs
4. If no mismatches: display "API docs are in sync", proceed to Step 5
5. Present via AskUserQuestion:
   ```
   API Sync Review:
     Spec: {spec_path}
     Mismatches: {count}

     {list each mismatch}

   (A) Review each individually
   (B) Skip all
   ```
6. For each mismatch user approves: update spec, then stage and commit with `docs({NNN}): sync OpenAPI spec`

## Step 5: KB Entry Review

Review knowledge base entries captured during build and deliver.

1. Check `docs/INSTITUTIONAL_KNOWLEDGE.md` for recent entries related to Feature {NNN}
2. If no entries found: display "No KB entries to review", proceed to Step 6
3. Present each entry for validation: confirm accuracy, improve wording if needed
4. Commit any KB updates with `docs({NNN}): review KB entries`

## Step 6: PR Squash-Merge

Push the document branch, create a PR, and squash-merge to main.

1. If no commits on the document branch (`git log main..HEAD --oneline` is empty): display "No changes to merge — skipping PR", proceed to Step 7
2. Push: `git push -u origin {NNN}-document-stage`
3. Create PR:
   ```
   gh pr create --title "docs({NNN}): post-delivery quality review" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary
   Post-delivery documentation review for Feature {NNN}.

   {one-line summary per commit on the branch}

   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
   EOF
   )"
   ```
4. Squash-merge: `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`
5. Switch to main: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
6. Prune stale remote refs: `git remote prune origin`

## Step 7: Report

Display summary of all documentation activities:

```
DOCUMENT STAGE COMPLETE

Feature: {NNN}
PR: #{pr_number} (squash-merged)

Results:
  Code Simplification: {accepted/rejected/skipped/no changes}
  Docs-Lint: {N functions documented / skipped / no flags}
  CHANGELOG: {N entries added / skipped / up to date}
  API Sync: {N mismatches resolved / skipped / in sync / no spec}
  KB Review: {N entries reviewed / no entries}
```
