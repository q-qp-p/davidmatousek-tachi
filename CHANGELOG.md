## [4.8.0](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/compare/v4.7.0...v4.8.0) (2026-04-09)


### Features

* **120:** add architecture lifecycle command ([#124](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/issues/124)) ([f814c02](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/commit/f814c027db03cf5424599b640bd99ac1aa8cd37e))

## [4.7.0](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/compare/v4.6.0...v4.7.0) (2026-04-09)


### Features

* **121:** rename tachi commands to tachi.* dot-namespace ([#122](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/issues/122)) ([7d0f968](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/commit/7d0f9684166a8fd6af10517fcca3f1aa85abad73))

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Architecture Lifecycle Command** (Feature 120) — `/tachi.architecture` now tracks versions with YAML frontmatter (version, date, description, SHA-256 checksum), archives previous versions to `.archive/v{N}/`, and supports guided updates through change categories. `/tachi.threat-model` automatically snapshots the architecture file into each timestamped output folder for full traceability. Backward compatible with existing architecture files.

### Changed

- **Command Namespace Migration** (Feature 121) — All tachi pipeline commands renamed from unprefixed names to `tachi.*` namespace prefix. New `/tachi.architecture` command added. Install script now cleans up deprecated command files on upgrade. See migration table below.

#### Command Name Migration

| Old Command | New Command |
|-------------|-------------|
| `/threat-model` | `/tachi.threat-model` |
| `/risk-score` | `/tachi.risk-score` |
| `/compensating-controls` | `/tachi.compensating-controls` |
| `/infographic` | `/tachi.infographic` |
| `/security-report` | `/tachi.security-report` |
| *(new)* | `/tachi.architecture` |

Upgrading: Run `install.sh` — it automatically removes old unprefixed command files and installs the new `tachi.*` versions.

## [4.6.0](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/compare/v4.5.0...v4.6.0) (2026-04-09)


### Features

* **119:** auto-polish release notes via Claude API after release ([a44127f](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/commit/a44127fccd11aef959cc1939670158ac8dffabb6)), closes [#119](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/issues/119)


### Bug Fixes

* **119:** move release notes polishing to local-only script ([0dd33fd](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/commit/0dd33fd4c4fd686393207837485386afac16ad03))

## [4.5.0](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/compare/v4.4.2...v4.5.0) (2026-04-09)

### Added

- **Attack Path Pages in PDF Reports** (Feature 112) — Each Critical and High finding with an attack tree now gets a dedicated page in the security report PDF, showing a rendered Mermaid diagram, plain-English narrative explaining the attack chain, and specific remediation steps. Pages are ordered by severity (Critical first) and introduced by an "Attack Path Analysis" section divider with TOC entry. Mermaid diagrams render to PNG at 2x resolution via `mmdc`; graceful text fallback when the tool is unavailable. Fully backward compatible — reports without attack trees generate identically to before.
- **Automated release notes polishing** (Feature 119) — Local script (`scripts/polish-release-notes.sh`) rewrites auto-generated release notes into user-facing language via Claude API. Run after merging a Release PR.
- **README refresh** — Updated with MAESTRO layer classification, `/security-report` command, baseline delta tracking, all 5 infographic templates, and 6 examples (was 3).

### Changed

- release-please now hides `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, and `style` commits from auto-generated CHANGELOG entries. Only `feat`, `fix`, and `perf` appear.

---

## [4.4.2](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/compare/v4.4.1...v4.4.2) (2026-04-09)

### Fixed

- MAESTRO heading detection now falls back gracefully when headings use inconsistent formatting in threat-report.md. Attack trees regenerated fresh for all 6 examples. MAESTRO Findings section now appears in all reports and PDF output.

---

## [4.4.1](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/compare/v4.4.0...v4.4.1) (2026-04-09)

### Fixed

- Attack tree generation no longer includes RESOLVED findings. Previously, findings marked as resolved in a baseline comparison still produced attack trees, cluttering the report with irrelevant attack paths.

---

## [4.4.0](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/compare/v4.3.4...v4.4.0) (2026-04-09)

### Added

- **Downstream Baseline Propagation** (Feature 104) — Baseline severity and status fields from `threats.md` now propagate through all pipeline stages: risk scoring, compensating controls, threat report, infographics, and PDF report. Delta annotations (NEW, UNCHANGED, UPDATED, RESOLVED) carry through the entire pipeline. New Section 8 (Delta Summary) in `threats.md` and `threat-report.md`. All 6 example outputs regenerated with baseline columns.

---

## [4.3.4](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/compare/v4.3.3...v4.3.4) (2026-04-08)

### Fixed

- Baseline-aware pipeline now enforces mandatory Phase 2 discovery even when a baseline exists, preventing false confidence from carry-forward-only runs.

---

## [4.3.3](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/compare/v4.3.2...v4.3.3) (2026-04-08)

### Fixed

- Baseline auto-detection now correctly resolves paths, and downstream commands (`/risk-score`, `/compensating-controls`) no longer exceed context limits when processing large baseline files.

---

## [4.3.2](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/compare/v4.3.1...v4.3.2) (2026-04-08)

### Fixed

- Version reporting (`install.sh`) now fetches tags before checking the installed version, showing the correct tag instead of a commit hash.
- release-please respects `release-please-config.json` instead of using a hardcoded release type.

---

## [4.3.1](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/compare/v4.3.0...v4.3.1) (2026-04-08)

### Fixed

- Version examples in README and `install.sh` now auto-bump via release-please extra-files configuration.

---

## [4.3.0](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/compare/v4.2.1...v4.3.0) (2026-04-08)

### Added

- **MAESTRO Infographic Templates and PDF Report Section** (Feature 091) — Two new infographic templates for MAESTRO-aware threat visualization: `maestro-stack` (vertical seven-layer risk distribution diagram) and `maestro-heatmap` (component-by-layer severity grid). New MAESTRO Findings page in the PDF security report. `maestro` shorthand in `/infographic` generates both templates in one invocation. All gated by `has-maestro-data` for backward compatibility with non-agentic threat models.

---

## [4.2.1](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/compare/v4.2.0...v4.2.1) (2026-04-08)

### Fixed

- release-please workflow now supports `workflow_dispatch` for manual re-runs.

---

## [4.2.0](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/compare/v4.1.0...v4.2.0) (2026-04-08)

### Added

- **MAESTRO Layer Mapping** (Feature 084) — Every threat finding is now classified into the CSA MAESTRO seven-layer taxonomy (L1 Foundation Model through L7 User Interface). The orchestrator assigns layers via keyword classification in Phase 1, and the mapping propagates downstream through risk scoring, compensating controls, and the threat report. New `maestro_layer` field in the finding schema (v1.2), SARIF `maestro-layer` tags, and MAESTRO Layer columns in all output tables. All 6 example outputs regenerated.

---

## [4.1.0](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/compare/v4.0.0...v4.1.0) (2026-04-07)

### Added

- **Automated Release Tagging** (Feature 086) — Releases are now automated via Google's release-please GitHub Action. Conventional commits on main trigger a Release PR with auto-generated CHANGELOG entries. Merging the Release PR creates the git tag and GitHub Release. New files: `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`, `release-please-config.json`, `.release-please-manifest.json`.
