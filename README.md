## What is tachi?

tachi is a threat modeling sidecar that you add to any project. It dispatches 12 specialized threat agents against your architecture description and produces a complete threat model in one command. Four post-pipeline commands enrich your results: `/risk-score` for quantitative scoring, `/compensating-controls` for codebase control analysis, `/infographic` for visual risk diagrams, and `/security-report` for a professional PDF assessment booklet.

- **11 threat categories**: 6 STRIDE + 3 LLM-specific + 2 Agentic
- **MAESTRO layer mapping**: CSA seven-layer taxonomy (L1-L7) for agentic AI threat classification
- **5 input formats**: Mermaid, free-text, ASCII, PlantUML, C4
- **5 commands, 20+ artifacts**: structured findings, SARIF, narrative report, attack trees, risk scores, compensating controls, 5 infographic templates, PDF security report
- **Baseline delta tracking**: Compare runs to track new, resolved, and unchanged findings over time
- **Works with any stack**: tachi analyzes architecture, not code

tachi is built with the [Agentic Oriented Development Kit (AOD Kit)](https://github.com/davidmatousek/agentic-oriented-development-kit), a governance framework for AI agent-assisted development.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone tachi (one-time)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi.git ~/Projects/tachi
```

### 2. Add tachi to your project

From your project root:

```bash
~/Projects/tachi/scripts/install.sh
```

To install a specific version:

```bash
~/Projects/tachi/scripts/install.sh --version v4.5.0 # x-release-please-version
```

If tachi is cloned to a non-default location:

```bash
~/Projects/tachi/scripts/install.sh --source /path/to/tachi
```

<details>
<summary>Manual install (alternative)</summary>

```bash
# Agents (threat analysis engine)
cp -r ~/Projects/tachi/.claude/agents/tachi/ .claude/agents/tachi/

# Commands (5 slash commands)
mkdir -p .claude/commands
for cmd in threat-model risk-score compensating-controls infographic security-report; do
  cp ~/Projects/tachi/.claude/commands/$cmd.md .claude/commands/
done

# Schemas, templates, references, and brand assets
cp -r ~/Projects/tachi/schemas/ schemas/
cp -r ~/Projects/tachi/templates/ templates/
mkdir -p adapters/claude-code/agents
cp -r ~/Projects/tachi/adapters/claude-code/agents/references/ adapters/claude-code/agents/references/
cp -r ~/Projects/tachi/brand/ brand/

# Developer guide
mkdir -p docs/guides
cp ~/Projects/tachi/docs/guides/DEVELOPER_GUIDE_TACHI.md docs/guides/
```

</details>

See [`INSTALL_MANIFEST.md`](INSTALL_MANIFEST.md) for the full list of distributable files.

### 3. Restart Claude Code

After copying the files, **restart Claude Code** (close and reopen the VS Code window, or start a new CLI session) so it picks up the new agents and commands.

If you want infographic images (`.jpg`), set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable with a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). This is optional — all text-based outputs work without it.

### 4. Create your architecture file (or let Claude Code do it)

Create `docs/security/architecture.md` describing your system. You can write it yourself or ask Claude Code:

```
Investigate this repository's architecture -- source code, config files, infrastructure
definitions, READMEs -- and create docs/security/architecture.md as a Mermaid flowchart
with all major components, data flows, protocols, and trust boundaries.
```

tachi auto-detects the format. Mermaid, free-text, ASCII, PlantUML, and C4 are all supported.

### 5. Run your first threat model

```
/threat-model
```

That's it. One command. tachi validates the setup, reads your architecture, dispatches 12 threat agents, and writes everything to a timestamped folder under `docs/security/`.

### 6. Review your results

| File | Source | What It Contains |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| `threats.md` | `/threat-model` | Primary threat model -- findings, coverage matrix, MAESTRO layers, risk summary |
| `threats.sarif` | `/threat-model` | SARIF 2.1.0 for GitHub Code Scanning and CI/CD integration |
| `threat-report.md` | `/threat-model` | Narrative report with executive summary and remediation roadmap |
| `attack-trees/` | `/threat-model` | One Mermaid attack tree per Critical/High finding |
| `risk-scores.md` | `/risk-score` | Quantitative risk scores with CVSS, exploitability, scalability, reachability |
| `risk-scores.sarif` | `/risk-score` | SARIF 2.1.0 with composite scores as `security-severity` per finding |
| `compensating-controls.md` | `/compensating-controls` | Detected codebase controls, residual risk, missing control recommendations |
| `compensating-controls.sarif` | `/compensating-controls` | SARIF 2.1.0 with residual risk as `security-severity` per finding |
| `threat-baseball-card.jpg` | `/infographic` | Baseball Card risk dashboard (requires `GEMINI_API_KEY`) |
| `threat-system-architecture.jpg` | `/infographic` | Annotated architecture diagram with finding legend |
| `threat-risk-funnel.jpg` | `/infographic` | Risk distribution funnel by severity |
| `threat-maestro-stack.jpg` | `/infographic` | MAESTRO layer stack visualization (agentic systems only) |
| `threat-maestro-heatmap.jpg` | `/infographic` | MAESTRO layer x severity heat map (agentic systems only) |
| `security-report.pdf` | `/security-report` | Professional PDF booklet with all artifacts assembled |

Start with `threats.md` Section 7 -- Recommended Actions. Then run `/risk-score` for quantitative prioritization, `/compensating-controls` to detect existing defenses, `/infographic` for visual risk diagrams, and `/security-report` to assemble everything into a PDF booklet. Work through Critical findings first, then High.

## Command Options

### /threat-model

Runs the 5-phase threat modeling pipeline: scope, determine threats, determine countermeasures, assess, and report. Produces `threats.md`, `threats.sarif`, `threat-report.md`, and `attack-trees/`. Findings include MAESTRO layer classification for agentic AI components. Automatically detects baseline from previous runs for delta tracking.

```bash
# Default -- uses docs/security/architecture.md
/threat-model

# Specify architecture file
/threat-model path/to/my-architecture.md

# Custom output directory
/threat-model docs/security/architecture.md --output-dir reports/security/

# Version-tagged output for a release
/threat-model docs/security/architecture.md --version v1.0.0

# Explicit baseline for delta comparison
/threat-model docs/security/architecture.md --baseline docs/security/2026-03-01/threats.md
```

### /risk-score

Enriches threat model output with four-dimensional quantitative risk scores (CVSS 3.1, exploitability, scalability, reachability) and governance fields (owner, SLA, disposition, review date). Produces `risk-scores.md` and `risk-scores.sarif`.

```bash
# Score threats in the default location
/risk-score

# Score threats in a specific directory
/risk-score docs/security/2026-03-27/

# Custom output directory
/risk-score docs/security/2026-03-27/ --output-dir reports/risk/
```

### /compensating-controls

Scans a target codebase against scored threats to detect existing security controls, calculate residual risk, and recommend missing controls. Requires `/risk-score` output as input. Produces `compensating-controls.md` and `compensating-controls.sarif`.

```bash
# Scan current project against risk scores in the default location
/compensating-controls

# Scan against risk scores in a specific directory
/compensating-controls docs/security/2026-03-27/

# Scan a different codebase
/compensating-controls docs/security/2026-03-27/ --target ~/Projects/my-app/

# Custom output directory
/compensating-controls docs/security/2026-03-27/ --output-dir reports/controls/
```

### /infographic

Generates visual threat infographic specifications and presentation-ready images. Auto-detects the richest data source in the output directory (prefers `compensating-controls.md` > `risk-scores.md` > `threats.md`). Produces spec markdown and `.jpg` images (images require `GEMINI_API_KEY`).

**Templates**: `baseball-card`, `system-architecture`, `risk-funnel`, `maestro-stack`, `maestro-heatmap`, `all`

```bash
# Generate all templates (auto-includes MAESTRO if data present)
/infographic

# Generate from a specific directory
/infographic docs/security/2026-03-27/

# Generate a specific template
/infographic docs/security/2026-03-27/ --template baseball-card
/infographic docs/security/2026-03-27/ --template risk-funnel

# Generate both MAESTRO templates
/infographic docs/security/2026-03-27/ --template maestro
```

### /security-report

Assembles all pipeline artifacts into a professional multi-page PDF security assessment booklet. Auto-detects available artifacts and conditionally includes pages. Requires `typst` CLI for PDF compilation and optionally `mmdc` (Mermaid CLI) for attack path diagram rendering.

**Page types** (conditional, based on available artifacts):
Cover, Disclaimer, Table of Contents, Risk Methodology, Assessment Scope, Executive Summary, Attack Path Analysis, MAESTRO Findings, Infographic pages (full-bleed), Findings Detail, Control Coverage, Remediation Roadmap

```bash
# Generate PDF from the default location
/security-report

# Generate from a specific directory
/security-report docs/security/2026-03-27/

# Custom output path
/security-report docs/security/2026-03-27/ --output reports/assessment.pdf
```

## How It Works

tachi uses a multi-agent orchestration pattern. The orchestrator parses your architecture, identifies components and data flows, then dispatches the right combination of 12 threat agents per component:

| Component Type | STRIDE Agents | AI Agents |
|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| External Entity (users, APIs) | S, R | -- |
| Process (servers, agents) | S, T, R, I, D, E | LLM + AG if AI keywords detected |
| Data Store (databases, caches) | T, I, D | -- |
| Data Flow (API calls, messages) | T, I, D | -- |

AI agents activate when component names or descriptions contain keywords like "LLM", "agent", "orchestrator", "MCP", "tool server", "embedding", "RAG", etc.

After all agents report, the orchestrator deduplicates findings, runs cross-agent correlation, computes risk ratings, and generates the output suite.

### MAESTRO Layer Classification

For agentic AI systems, tachi maps each finding to the [CSA MAESTRO](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/) seven-layer taxonomy:

| Layer | Name | Scope |
|-------|------|-------|
| L1 | Foundation Model | Pre-trained LLMs, inference engines |
| L2 | Data Operations | Vector stores, RAG pipelines, embeddings |
| L3 | Agent Framework | Orchestrators, tool servers, MCP |
| L4 | Deployment Infrastructure | API gateways, containers, networking |
| L5 | Security | Auth, guardrails, rate limiting |
| L6 | Agent Ecosystem | Multi-agent coordination, delegation |
| L7 | User Interface | Chat UIs, dashboards, API endpoints |

MAESTRO layers appear in `threats.md`, propagate through all downstream commands, and power the `maestro-stack` and `maestro-heatmap` infographic templates.

### Baseline Delta Tracking

When you run `/threat-model` on a system that already has a previous run, tachi automatically detects the baseline and computes a delta: new findings, resolved findings, unchanged findings, and updated findings. This lets you track risk posture changes over time without manual diffing.

## Threat Categories

### STRIDE (6 categories)

| Category | Threat | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **S**poofing | Identity impersonation | Stolen API key used to make authenticated requests |
| **T**ampering | Unauthorized data modification | SQL injection modifying database records |
| **R**epudiation | Missing accountability | User denies triggering an expensive operation, no logs exist |
| **I**nformation Disclosure | Data exposure | Error messages leaking internal architecture details |
| **D**enial of Service | Availability attacks | Request flooding exhausting connection pools |
| **E**levation of Privilege | Unauthorized access | Regular user accessing admin endpoints |

### AI-Specific (5 categories)

| Category | Threat | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Prompt Injection** (LLM) | Adversarial inputs hijacking LLM behavior | Hidden instructions in a document causing the LLM to leak its system prompt |
| **Data Poisoning** (LLM) | Corrupted training/RAG data | Attacker modifying knowledge base documents to spread misinformation |
| **Model Theft** (LLM) | Model extraction | Competitor reverse-engineering your fine-tuned model via API queries |
| **Agent Autonomy** (AG) | Insufficient oversight | AI agent sending 500 emails without human approval |
| **Tool Abuse** (AG) | Tool misuse or manipulation | Malicious plugin exfiltrating source code when invoked |

## Known Issues

### Finding count variance between runs

Successive threat model runs on the same architecture may produce slightly different finding counts (typically +/- 10%). This is expected behavior with LLM-based analysis.

**What's consistent**: Core findings across all STRIDE and AI categories. The same high-severity threats will appear in every run.

**What varies**: Borderline findings in the long tail -- a Medium-severity finding like "missing correlation ID on external API calls" may appear in one run but not the next, depending on how the agent reasons through the architecture.

**Why this happens**: Each of the 12 threat agents makes independent LLM calls. LLM output is non-deterministic by nature, so agents may surface slightly different findings on each invocation.

**If you need higher consistency**:
- Run twice and diff the results to catch edge cases
- Use a previous run's `threats.md` as a baseline for comparison
- Treat the threat model as a living document that improves with each run
