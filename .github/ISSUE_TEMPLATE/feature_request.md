> **Not a maintainer or promoting from a Discussion?**
> Feature requests start as [Discussions](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/discussions/categories/feature-requests), not Issues. Post your proposal there — I promote threads to Issues once they have traction and an ICE score. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#how-feature-requests-become-work) for the lifecycle.

## Next Step (for contributors)

This Issue captures discovery context. To pick it up via tachi's AOD lifecycle (replace `<NNN>` with this Issue's number after creation):

1. **Re-score** (if priority needs validation against current strategy): `/aod.score <NNN>`
2. **Promote to PRD**: `/aod.define <NNN>` — generates `docs/product/02_PRD/<NNN>-*.md` with Triad sign-offs (PM + Architect + Team-Lead)
3. **Plan**: `/aod.plan` — chains spec → project-plan → tasks
4. **Build**: `/aod.build` — implements per the plan with quality gates
5. **Deliver**: `/aod.deliver <NNN>` — closure + retrospective

External contributors: see [docs/AOD_TRIAD.md](docs/AOD_TRIAD.md) for governance overview, or jump straight to `/aod.define <NNN>` if scope is already clear from this Issue body.
