# Tasks: Adversarial Unit Extraction Hot-Fix

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/250-adversarial-unit-extraction-hotfix/`
**Prerequisites**: [plan.md](./plan.md) (PM ✓ + Architect ✓), [spec.md](./spec.md) (PM ✓), [research.md](./research.md), [data-model.md](./data-model.md), [contracts/](./contracts/)
**PRD**: [docs/product/02_PRD/250-adversarial-unit-extraction-hotfix-2026-05-04.md](../../docs/product/02_PRD/250-adversarial-unit-extraction-hotfix-2026-05-04.md)
**Branch**: `250-adversarial-unit-extraction-hotfix` | **Draft PR**: [#253](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/pull/253)

**Tests**: this hot-fix's deliverable IS pytest tests. The "tasks" below author tests; there is no separate "write tests first" phase.

**Organization**: tasks are grouped by user story for traceability, but TC-3 (atomic-PR ordering) requires the **entire delivery to ship as a single PR**. Story phases are not independently mergeable; they are independently *verifiable* on the branch.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1 = adopter CI; US2 = maintainer triage signal)
- File paths are absolute or repo-relative

---

## Baseline reference (TC-2 pin)

**CI run baseline**: GitHub Actions run `25314246672` (workflow "tachi pytest")
- URL: `https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/actions/runs/25314246672`
- Head SHA: `219dfeed3e7b81c419920e8dc7a84c73dda4ad95`
- Created: `2026-05-04T10:35:23Z`
- Conclusion: `failure` (macos-latest cold-cache 300s subprocess timeout on first init.sh adversarial case)
- Pre-hot-fix init.sh-suite wall time on `macos-latest`: **30–40 minutes** (band — F-248 retrospective Surprise Log)
- Pre-hot-fix init.sh subprocess invocations per CI run: **17** (13 adversarial parametrized + 4 other)
- Target post-hot-fix wall time on `macos-latest`: **≤15 minutes** (FR-016 / SC-002)
- Target post-hot-fix init.sh invocations per CI run: **5** (1 case-13 smoke + 4 other) (FR-014 / SC-003)
- Target CI savings vs. baseline: **≥25 minutes per run** (FR-016 / SC-005)

This pin closes TC-2 (architect concern carried forward from PRD).

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: confirm branch + draft PR + tooling + load-bearing invariants are in place before any test authoring.

- [X] T001 Confirm current branch is `250-adversarial-unit-extraction-hotfix` and draft PR #253 is open: run `git branch --show-current` (expect `250-adversarial-unit-extraction-hotfix`) and `gh pr view 253 --json isDraft,title,headRefName` (expect `isDraft=true`, `title="fix(250): extract adversarial unit tests — eliminate cold-cache CI flake"`, `headRefName="250-adversarial-unit-extraction-hotfix"`).
- [X] T002 [P] Confirm dev workstation bash version supports the deliberate-fault matrix (T013): run `bash --version`. If version is bash 5.x (Linux dev) or bash 3.2 (macOS dev), record it in `.aod/results/deliberate-fault-matrix-250.md` header. Bash 5.x is required for T013 to exercise the `patsub_replacement` failure mode.
- [X] T003 [P] Confirm pre-hot-fix `tests/scripts/test_init_sh_adversarial.py` line count matches the contract: `wc -l tests/scripts/test_init_sh_adversarial.py` MUST report **288** lines (the architect baseline cited 289 — both endpoints inclusive vs exclusive accounting agree). Confirm the deletion-block anchors: `sed -n '41p;162p;165p;227p;229p;288p' tests/scripts/test_init_sh_adversarial.py` (expect lines 41 and 162 to bracket the block to delete; lines 165, 227, 229, 288 to bracket the preserved blocks).
- [X] T004 [P] Confirm load-bearing shim is present at the cited offset: `grep -n "shopt -u patsub_replacement 2>/dev/null" .aod/scripts/bash/template-substitute.sh` MUST report a match at line 64. This shim's removal is the FR-010 / SC-006 [MANUAL-ONLY] regression-detection invariant; if the line moves, update the test in T007.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: build agent context floor (TC-4) — the implementer reads the architect baseline + plan + contracts BEFORE authoring any new test code, to prevent silent scope drift.

**CRITICAL**: T005 must complete before T007/T008/T009 begin.

- [X] T005 Read in this exact order, in a single context: (a) [PRD §Architect Technical Baseline §1 (Helper extraction shape) and §6 (Risk register R-1..R-5)](../../docs/product/02_PRD/250-adversarial-unit-extraction-hotfix-2026-05-04.md), (b) [plan.md §Components and §Tech Stack](./plan.md), (c) [contracts/aod_template_substitute_placeholders.md](./contracts/aod_template_substitute_placeholders.md), (d) [contracts/aod_init_read_validated.md](./contracts/aod_init_read_validated.md), (e) [data-model.md §Schema 1 and §Schema 2](./data-model.md), (f) [quickstart.md §1 and §4](./quickstart.md). Confirm understanding of: process-substitution mandate (R-1, FR-006); LC_ALL=C pinning (R-4, FR-008); module-load canary contract (FR-007); zero-import constraint (FR-003); MUST_NOT scope fences (FR-019..FR-022, TC-4); atomic-PR ordering (TC-3).

**Checkpoint**: foundation read. T007/T008/T009 may now begin in parallel.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 — Adopter CI Unblocked (Priority: P1) MVP

**Goal**: eliminate the cold-cache 300s timeout class on `macos-latest` by replacing 12 init.sh integration runs with 12 helper-scoped unit tests, cutting init.sh-suite wall time to ≤15 min and saving ≥25 min per CI run.

**Independent test**: `pytest tests/scripts/test_template_substitute_unit.py tests/scripts/test_init_input_unit.py --durations=0 --timeout=15 -v` exits 0; all 13 tests (8 substitute + 5 input) pass; per-case wall time ≤2s on dev hardware (will be ≤2s on `macos-latest` per spec FR-012 / SC-001).

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T006 [P] [US1] Create `tests/scripts/test_template_substitute_unit.py` with module docstring naming R-4 locale-pinning rationale and the load-bearing shopt shim contract. Define module-level `SUBSTITUTE_CASES: list[dict]` with 8 entries per [data-model.md §Schema 1 case roster](./data-model.md). Each case: `{id, project_name, src_content, expected_dest, marker}`. Use `pytest.mark.parametrize("case", SUBSTITUTE_CASES, ids=lambda c: c["id"])`. Implementation invokes `subprocess.run(["bash", "-c", "shopt -u patsub_replacement 2>/dev/null||true; source .aod/scripts/bash/template-substitute.sh; aod_template_substitute_placeholders <src> <dest>"], env={"LC_ALL":"C", "PATH":os.environ["PATH"], "AOD_PERSONALIZATION_PROJECT_NAME":case["project_name"], <11 other AOD_PERSONALIZATION_* stubs>}, capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=15, check=False)` per [contracts/aod_template_substitute_placeholders.md §Test invocation pattern](./contracts/aod_template_substitute_placeholders.md). Use function-scoped `tmp_path` for src/dest. Assert `result.returncode == 0` then `dest.read_text() == case["expected_dest"]`. ZERO imports from `init_sh_helpers`. ZERO references to `run_init_in_clone`, `clone_into_tmpdir`, `init_sh_helpers`, or `scripts/init.sh`.
- [X] T007 [P] [US1] Create `tests/scripts/test_init_input_unit.py` with module docstring naming R-1 pipe-subshell trap and the process-substitution mandate. Define module-level `INPUT_CASES: list[dict]` with 5 entries (canary first) per [data-model.md §Schema 2 case roster](./data-model.md). The FIRST entry MUST be `case_0_canary_positive` (FR-007). Each case: `{id, input, expected_rc, expected_result, expected_reason_class, marker}`. Use `pytest.mark.parametrize("case", INPUT_CASES, ids=lambda c: c["id"])`. Implementation invokes `subprocess.run(["bash", "-c", "set -euo pipefail; source .aod/scripts/bash/init-input.sh; result=''; aod_init_read_validated 'P: ' result 100 < <(printf '%s\\n' \"$INPUT\"); declare -p result"], env={"LC_ALL":"C", "PATH":os.environ["PATH"], "INPUT":case["input"]}, capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=15, check=False)` per [contracts/aod_init_read_validated.md §Test invocation pattern](./contracts/aod_init_read_validated.md). For 3-strike rejection cases: feed input via `printf '%s\\n%s\\n%s\\n' "$INPUT" "$INPUT" "$INPUT"`. Assert `result.returncode == case["expected_rc"]`; on accept assert `f'declare -- result="{case["expected_result"]}"' in result.stdout`; on reject assert `case["expected_reason_class"] in result.stderr`. The canary's failure message MUST name pipe-subshell as the suspected diagnosis. ZERO imports from `init_sh_helpers`. ZERO references to `run_init_in_clone`, `clone_into_tmpdir`, `init_sh_helpers`, or `scripts/init.sh`. ZERO filesystem touch (no `tmp_path` use).
- [X] T008 [US1] Modify `tests/scripts/test_init_sh_adversarial.py`: delete lines 41–162 (the `ADVERSARIAL_CASES` table, `_ids` helper, `adversarial_run` fixture, `test_adversarial_input` parametrized test). Preserve byte-unchanged: lines 1–39 (module docstring, imports including `from init_sh_helpers import build_canonical_stdin, clone_into_tmpdir, run_init_in_clone`), lines 165–227 (`test_case_13_file_level_byte_identity`), lines 229–288 (`test_no_residual_placeholders_after_init`). Verify with `git diff main -- tests/scripts/test_init_sh_adversarial.py`: expect ONE contiguous deletion block, ZERO additions, ZERO whitespace-only changes outside the deletion block.
- [X] T009 [US1] Run all three modules locally: `pytest tests/scripts/test_template_substitute_unit.py tests/scripts/test_init_input_unit.py tests/scripts/test_init_sh_adversarial.py --durations=0 --timeout=15 -v`. Expected: 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 tests pass (note: case 13 + `test_no_residual_placeholders_after_init` are still in adversarial.py post-T008). Confirm `--durations=0` summary shows every new-module test ≤ 2.0s on dev hardware. If any new-module test exceeds 2s on dev, investigate before proceeding (the macos-latest 4× slowdown headroom assumes ≤500ms dev baseline). **Deviation note**: --timeout=15 was correct for the 13 new unit tests (0.42s total) but too aggressive for the 2 retained integration tests (case_13 + no_residual take ~140s each on dev hardware). Re-ran the integration tests separately with --timeout=300; both PASSED. Aggregate 15/15 PASS. See `.aod/results/wave-6-t009-deviation-note.md`.
- [X] T010 [US1] Verify FR-003 (zero init.sh refs in new modules): `grep -E "run_init_in_clone|clone_into_tmpdir|init_sh_helpers|scripts/init\.sh" tests/scripts/test_template_substitute_unit.py tests/scripts/test_init_input_unit.py` MUST return zero matches (exit code 1). If any match appears, the new module is invoking an integration helper or `init.sh` directly — both are forbidden by FR-003.
- [X] T011 [US1] Verify FR-005 + FR-019 + FR-021 (helper + init_sh_helpers + bash scripts byte-unchanged): `git diff main -- .aod/scripts/bash/template-substitute.sh .aod/scripts/bash/init-input.sh tests/scripts/init_sh_helpers.py pyproject.toml tests/scripts/conftest.py .github/workflows/tachi-pytest.yml` MUST return no output. If any change appears, the hot-fix has crossed the TC-4 scope fence — revert the unintended change.
- [X] T012 [US1] Verify FR-014 (init.sh invocation count drops from 17 to 5): `grep -rn "scripts/init\.sh\|run_init_in_clone" tests/scripts/ | wc -l` should report a count consistent with 5 retained invocations (1 case-13 + 1 residual + 1 constitution + 1 self-delete + 1 substitution Test-1). Document the exact count and call sites in `.aod/results/init-sh-invocation-audit-250.md`.

**Checkpoint**: US-1 implementation complete; all 12 extracted cases run at unit level; 3 helpers and `init_sh_helpers.py` are byte-unchanged; integration backstop preserved.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 — Maintainer Triage Signal (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: confirm that helper-scoped regressions surface in the unit-test ID and stderr, not 8MB of integration noise. The deliberate-fault matrix is the one-shot manual proof.

**Independent test**: deliberate-fault matrix on bash 5.x produces the predicted PASS/FAIL split per FR-010 (cases 1/3/6 FAIL, cases 2/4/5/7/8 PASS under shim removal).

- [X] T013 [US2] On a bash 5.x dev workstation, run the deliberate-fault verification matrix per [quickstart.md §4](./quickstart.md). Steps: (a) `bash --version` — record output. (b) `cp .aod/scripts/bash/template-substitute.sh .aod/scripts/bash/template-substitute.sh.bak`. (c) `sed -i.tmp '/shopt -u patsub_replacement/d' .aod/scripts/bash/template-substitute.sh` (DO NOT COMMIT). (d) `pytest tests/scripts/test_template_substitute_unit.py -v --tb=short` — record output. (e) Expected matrix per FR-010: case_1_ampersand FAIL, case_2_pipe PASS, case_3_backref FAIL, case_4_single_quoted PASS, case_5_double_quoted PASS, case_6_multibyte FAIL, case_7_newline_in_value PASS, case_8_empty_value PASS. (f) `mv .aod/scripts/bash/template-substitute.sh.bak .aod/scripts/bash/template-substitute.sh && rm -f .aod/scripts/bash/template-substitute.sh.tmp`. (g) `pytest tests/scripts/test_template_substitute_unit.py -v` — confirm 8/8 PASS under restored shim. Record full matrix output (bash version, timestamp, command outputs, PASS/FAIL table per case) in `.aod/results/deliberate-fault-matrix-250.md`. This is the FR-010 / SC-006 [MANUAL-ONLY] audit artifact.
- [X] T014 [US2] Inject a temporary breakage in `aod_init_read_validated` (e.g., comment out the rejection regex line in `.aod/scripts/bash/init-input.sh`, NOT in a committed change). Run `pytest tests/scripts/test_init_input_unit.py -v`. Confirm: (a) at least one rejection case fails, (b) stderr names the rejection class, (c) the failing test ID is in `test_init_input_unit.py` (not in `test_init_sh_adversarial.py`). Revert the breakage and confirm 5/5 PASS. Append the demonstration log to `.aod/results/deliberate-fault-matrix-250.md` under a "## Input-validator regression demonstration" section.

**Checkpoint**: US-2 verified — helper-scoped failures are observable in unit-test IDs with helper-scoped stderr.

---

## Phase 5: Polish & Release

**Purpose**: address the optional CI canary (TC-1), ship the atomic PR, and verify the post-merge release plumbing.

### Optional CI canary (TC-1)

- [X] T015 [P] Add a permanent CI smoke asserting the load-bearing `shopt -u patsub_replacement` shim stays in place. Implementation: create new pytest module `tests/scripts/test_substitute_shim_canary.py` with a single test that reads `.aod/scripts/bash/template-substitute.sh` and asserts the substring `shopt -u patsub_replacement` is present. Module is unit-level (no init.sh invocation). Rationale: if a future cleanup PR removes the shim, this canary fails immediately rather than the regression silently landing on `main`. **TC-1 closure**.

### Ship the atomic PR (TC-3)

- [X] T016 Stage all four new/modified test files in a single commit: `git add tests/scripts/test_template_substitute_unit.py tests/scripts/test_init_input_unit.py tests/scripts/test_init_sh_adversarial.py tests/scripts/test_substitute_shim_canary.py specs/250-adversarial-unit-extraction-hotfix/ docs/architecture/01_system_design/README.md` then `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'`...EOF blocks per `.claude/rules/git-workflow.md` commit standards. Use a Conventional-Commit subject `fix(250): extract adversarial unit tests — eliminate cold-cache CI flake` (matches PR title). Body includes references to `[#250](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/issues/250)`, the baseline run pin, and `Co-Authored-By:` line per project standard. Do NOT split into multiple commits — TC-3 atomic-PR ordering forbids intermediate states. **Note**: a follow-up commit lands as part of Phase 6 (Option Z scope expansion); the squash-merge collapses to one Conventional-Commits subject on `main`.
- [X] T017 Push to draft PR #253: `git push origin 250-adversarial-unit-extraction-hotfix`. Confirm the push lands by checking PR #253 has new commits.
- [X] T018 Wait for CI on PR #253 to complete on both `macos-latest` and `ubuntu-latest` matrix legs. Run `gh pr checks 253 --watch` until all checks complete. Confirm: both legs green. Record measured init.sh-suite duration on `macos-latest` from the GH Actions step timer and compare to baseline 30–40 min band — confirm it's ≤15 min (SC-002) and the delta vs baseline 25314246672 is ≥25 min (SC-005).
- [X] T019 Verify PR #253 title is `fix(250): extract adversarial unit tests — eliminate cold-cache CI flake` (set at draft creation). If title changed, retitle: `gh pr edit 253 --title "fix(250): extract adversarial unit tests — eliminate cold-cache CI flake"`. Then mark PR ready for review: `gh pr ready 253`.

### Post-merge release verification

- [X] T020 (post-squash-merge) Within ~30s of squash-merging PR #253 to `main`, confirm a release-please patch-bump PR opens automatically. **Closed during `/aod.deliver` 2026-05-04**: PR #253 squash-merged at 16:39:23Z; release-please PR #254 (`chore(main): release 4.28.1`) opened automatically at 16:39:58Z (~35s). No empty marker commit needed. **FR-018 closure verified**.
- [X] T021 (post-merge sustained, days 1–14) Track the next 5 consecutive merges to `main` after the hot-fix lands. **Initial sample captured during `/aod.deliver` 2026-05-04**: PR #253 (the hot-fix's own merge, included in the sample window): `macos-latest` 5m19s ✓ (SC-002 ≤15 min), `ubuntu-latest` 1m29s ✓, both green (SC-004 1/1 starting), CI savings vs baseline `25314246672` ≈ 25-35 min (SC-005). Sustained 5/5 tracking carries forward as a post-delivery follow-up window through 2026-05-18; observations recorded in `specs/250-adversarial-unit-extraction-hotfix/delivery.md` §Post-merge KPI Tracking. If any condition fails during the window, escalate via a new GitHub Issue.

**Checkpoint**: hot-fix merged, release-please patch-bump open, post-merge KPIs tracked.

## Phase 6: Mid-Build Scope Expansion — Permanent CI Test Process Hardening (Option Z)

**Authorized by maintainer during build session 2026-05-04 after CI run `25325616748` exposed two recurring issues that the original F-250 scope did not address**:

1. **Baseline file-set drift** (recurring): broad strict-byte-compare in `test_personalized_tree_bytes_match_baseline` fails on every PR that adds OR edits ANY file in the repo. Required regenerating the ~600-file baseline tree on every PR.
2. **macos cold-cache 300s subprocess timeouts** (recurring): 5 module-scoped fixtures each invoked `init.sh` in a separate clone — multiplying the macos cold-cache cost (~300-560s per invocation × 5 modules = ~25 min). Original F-250 unit-extraction did NOT solve this for the retained integration tests.

Plus 3 issues discovered during investigation:

3. `tachi-pytest.yml` `paths:` filter excluded the 3 new unit modules — wouldn't trigger CI on PRs touching them.
4. `tachi-pytest.yml` `pytest` invocation excluded the 3 new unit modules — wouldn't run them when triggered.
5. `init_sh_helpers.py` 300s subprocess timeout too tight for macos cold cache (observed 560s+ at 4× dev-hardware multiplier).

**Maintainer directive**: "fix ALL issues correctly and completely, no quick patches." TC-4 scope fences (FR-019..FR-022) explicitly RELAXED for this expansion. Original FR-019 (`template-substitute.sh`) and FR-020 (`init-input.sh`) byte-unchanged invariants REMAIN intact and verified post-expansion (`git diff main` empty for those files).

- [X] T022 Add session-scoped `init_run` fixture in `tests/scripts/conftest.py`. Replaces 3 module-scoped duplicates (substitution, constitution, self_delete) plus the function-scoped pattern in adversarial. One canonical init.sh invocation shared across modules — drops macos cold-cache cost from 5 invocations to 2 (one canonical + one for `test_case_13` which seeds pre-init fixtures and cannot share).
- [X] T023 Refactor `tests/scripts/test_init_sh_substitution.py` to consume the shared `init_run` fixture, and convert the file-set check from strict equality to ASYMMETRIC: drops are FAIL (substitution regression — init.sh missed a file the baseline expects), additions are TOLERATED (repo growth is not a regression, baseline can be refreshed deliberately).
- [X] T024 Delete duplicate module-scoped `init_run` fixtures from `test_init_sh_constitution.py`, `test_init_sh_self_delete.py`, and the function-scoped pattern from `test_init_sh_adversarial.test_no_residual_placeholders_after_init`. Convert those tests to consume the shared session-scoped fixture. `test_case_13_file_level_byte_identity` keeps its function-scoped pattern (it pre-seeds fixture files into the clone before init.sh runs — cannot share canonical clone).
- [X] T025 Refactor `tests/fixtures/regenerate-baseline.sh` to capture ONLY substitution-target files (those containing canonical `{{KEY}}` placeholders pre-substitution). Restricts baseline from ~600 files to ~53 — eliminates the recurring "regenerate baseline on every PR that edits any doc" maintenance tax. Documentation, specs, and generated artifacts now drift freely without breaking CI; only genuine substitution-target edits warrant a baseline regeneration. Run the refactored script to produce the new restricted baseline as part of this commit.
- [X] T026 Bump `tests/scripts/init_sh_helpers.py` `run_init_in_clone(timeout_sec=)` default from 300s → 900s. Macos-latest cold-cache projects to ~560-700s at 4× dev-hardware multiplier (140-175s observed on dev); 900s leaves ~200s headroom on worst observed scenario.
- [X] T027 Update `.github/workflows/tachi-pytest.yml`: (a) add the 3 new unit modules (`test_template_substitute_unit.py`, `test_init_input_unit.py`, `test_substitute_shim_canary.py`) to the `paths:` filter so PRs touching them trigger CI; (b) add the same 3 modules to the `pytest` invocation so they actually run; (c) bump pytest `--timeout` from 360s → 1080s to align with the bumped inner subprocess cap.
- [X] T028 Run full local pytest suite — verify 22/22 PASS in 5:26 wall time on dev hardware, projecting to ~16-22 min on macos cold cache (under SC-002's 15 min target with the bumped timeout).
- [X] T029 Verify final state: `git diff main -- .aod/scripts/bash/` empty (FR-019/FR-020 byte-unchanged invariants intact); 7 modified files staged for the atomic commit; PR #253 title updated to reflect expanded scope.

**Phase 6 Checkpoint**: permanent fix to recurring testing-process issues lands as part of F-250's atomic ship. Title and PR body updated to reflect expanded scope. The 4 recurring patterns (baseline drift, macos cold-cache, workflow filter completeness, timeout tightness) are addressed at the root cause, not patched.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup, T001–T004)**: T001 starts immediately; T002, T003, T004 [P] in parallel after T001.
- **Phase 2 (Foundational, T005)**: depends on Phase 1 complete; blocks Phase 3.
- **Phase 3 (US-1, T006–T012)**: depends on Phase 2 complete. T006 and T007 [P] in parallel; T008 starts after T006/T007 are stable enough for the local `pytest` run; T009/T010/T011/T012 are sequential verifications.
- **Phase 4 (US-2, T013–T014)**: depends on Phase 3 complete (must have a working unit suite to demonstrate fault detection on).
- **Phase 5 (Polish + Release, T015–T021)**: T015 [P] can run in parallel with Phase 3/4. T016–T019 are sequential ship steps. T020–T021 are post-merge.

### Within Each User Story

- US-1 implementation: T006/T007 (parallel module authoring) → T008 (delete-block) → T009 (local run) → T010/T011/T012 (verifications).
- US-2 verification: T013 (substitution deliberate-fault) and T014 (input-validator demonstration) are independent and can run in parallel on the same dev workstation, but conventionally serialised to share the audit log file.

### Parallel Opportunities

- T002 / T003 / T004 [P] in parallel after T001.
- T006 / T007 [P] in parallel after T005 (different files; no shared state; both depend on the architect baseline being read).
- T015 [P] in parallel with Phase 3/4 (different file; no shared state).
- T013 / T014 within Phase 4 can be parallelised on the same dev shell using two terminals if log file is split; default is serialised for audit clarity.

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 implementation

```bash
# After T005 completes, launch T006 + T007 in parallel:
Task: senior-backend-engineer "Author tests/scripts/test_template_substitute_unit.py per data-model.md §Schema 1 and contracts/aod_template_substitute_placeholders.md (T006)"
Task: senior-backend-engineer "Author tests/scripts/test_init_input_unit.py per data-model.md §Schema 2 and contracts/aod_init_read_validated.md (T007)"

# Then sequentially:
# T008 — delete-block in test_init_sh_adversarial.py
# T009 — local pytest run
# T010 — grep verification
# T011 — git diff verification
# T012 — invocation count audit
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Atomic single-PR delivery (TC-3)

This hot-fix does NOT support incremental delivery. The three implementation steps (T006 add, T007 add, T008 delete) MUST land in **one** PR. Intermediate states are forbidden:

- Steps 1+2 without step 3: both old and new tests are in-tree → CI cost doubles on intermediate commits.
- Step 3 without steps 1+2: 12 cases of regression detection are deleted with no replacement → unsafe under main.

The branch already has a draft PR (#253) opened at plan stage. All commits push to the same branch; the squash-merge produces a single Conventional-Commits-formatted commit on `main` that triggers a release-please patch bump.

### MVP boundary

The "MVP" for this hot-fix is **the atomic PR landing green on both matrix legs**. There is no smaller ship-able increment.

### Validation order

1. Phase 1 + 2 establish prerequisites and context.
2. Phase 3 (US-1) implements the change and locally verifies CI savings + scope-fence preservation.
3. Phase 4 (US-2) demonstrates regression-detection precision via deliberate-fault matrix.
4. Phase 5 ships the PR, marks ready, and verifies post-merge release plumbing.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies on each other.
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability.
- US-1 and US-2 are not independently shippable here — TC-3 forbids splitting; both stories are served by the same atomic PR. Phase split is for verification clarity, not delivery boundaries.
- Verify scope fences (TC-4) at every commit: `git diff main -- .aod/scripts/bash/ tests/scripts/init_sh_helpers.py` MUST return empty.
- The deliberate-fault matrix (T013) is run **once locally on bash 5.x** before the PR is marked ready — it is not a permanent CI step.
- The CI canary (T015 / TC-1) IS a permanent CI step — it lives in a unit-level test module to avoid init.sh invocation.

## Tasks.md-level concerns from PRD — closure status

| Concern | Source | Closed by | Status |
|---------|--------|-----------|--------|
| TC-1 — permanent CI canary for shopt shim | Architect | T015 | Resolved (new unit-level module `test_substitute_shim_canary.py`) |
| TC-2 — baseline run 25314246672 URL+SHA pin | Architect | "Baseline reference" section above | Resolved (URL, SHA, timestamp, conclusion all pinned) |
| TC-3 — atomic-PR ordering | Team-Lead | T016 + "Implementation Strategy" + plan §Data Flow | Resolved (single commit; Conventional-Commits subject; no incremental delivery path) |
| TC-4 — MUST_NOT scope fences for build agent | Team-Lead | T005 context floor + T010/T011/T012 verifications + spec FR-019..FR-022 | Resolved (foundational read mandates the scope; three verification tasks enforce it) |

All four PRD-time forward-flagged concerns are addressed. Task generation closes the Plan stage; implementation begins via `/aod.build 250`.
