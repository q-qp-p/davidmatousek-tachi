The squash-merge (`7b1cc53 feat(272): SECURITY.md and private disclosure channel (#273)`) introduced changes only to documentation files (`SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, plus `specs/` and `docs/product/` artifacts). No code-extension files (`.py .js .ts .jsx .tsx .sh .go .rs .java .rb .swift .kt .php .cs .cpp .c .h`) and no dependency manifests (`requirements.txt`, `package.json`, `go.mod`, etc.) were modified. SAST and SCA both correctly skip via Step 1a/1b zero-file paths; clean-scan path (Step 5c) reaches PASSED.

## TACHI-VULN-05abc41ad4cc — REMEDIATED

The previously-DETECTED finding `TACHI-VULN-05abc41ad4cc` (INFO, A05 Security Misconfiguration — SECURITY.md missing private disclosure channel guidance) is now REMEDIATED on main per the Step 6c lifecycle rule. The remediation lifecycle is captured in `.security/vulnerabilities.jsonl`:

```
2026-05-02T10:51:56Z DETECTED    scan_id=5cd62414...  file=SECURITY.md  severity=INFO
2026-05-08T17:32:45Z REMEDIATED  scan_id=5345e7a2...  file=SECURITY.md  severity=INFO
```

**Remediation evidence** (delivered in PR #273):

- `SECURITY.md` Section "Reporting a Vulnerability" now references the GitHub *Report a vulnerability* button as primary instruction with the canonical `https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/security/advisories/new` fallback URL (FR-001 .. FR-004).
- GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting (PVR) toggle was confirmed ON at 15:34 UTC 2026-05-08 via repo settings UI (FR-007 + AC-6 + D-5; durable plain-text confirmation captured in PR #273 description and tasks.md T007/T017 result rows).
- README.md `## Community` section now contains a one-line pointer to SECURITY.md (FR-008 + T014).
- CHANGELOG.md F-3 entry (BLP-02 Wave 3) cites TACHI-VULN-05abc41ad4cc closure with INFO + A05 + BLP-02 Wave 3 metadata (FR-009 + T013).

## No New Findings Introduced (US3 / SC-006 confirmation)

Comparison against the pre-merge baseline (`.security/vulnerabilities.jsonl` state at scan_id 5cd62414 from 2026-05-02): zero new HIGH or MEDIUM findings, zero new LOW or INFO findings introduced by the F-3 changes. The only delta is the REMEDIATED event above.

*Security Scan: AI-powered analysis; supplement with dedicated SAST tools for production-critical systems. This re-scan validates the post-merge state of TACHI-VULN-05abc41ad4cc per FR-013; the underlying remediation is documentation-only (SECURITY.md content + GitHub repo settings toggle), so no SAST/SCA pattern detection is invoked.*
