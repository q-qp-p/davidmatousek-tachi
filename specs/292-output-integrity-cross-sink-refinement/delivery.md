# Delivery Document: Feature 292 — Output-Integrity Cross-Sink Refinement

**Delivery Date**: 2026-05-14
**Branch**: `292-output-integrity-cross-sink-refinement` (deleted post-merge)
**PR**: #293 (squash-merged 2026-05-14 17:02 UTC; SHA `0629fa2`)
**Release**: v4.36.0 (release-please PR #294)
**ADR**: ADR-045 (Accepted; SHA-pinned to `0629fa2`)

---

## What Was Delivered

- **Cat 6 Vector / Search-DSL Injection pattern surface** added to the `output-integrity` agent's detection-patterns catalog. Closes the multi-tenant RAG tenant-scoping gap: any LLM Process emitting Pinecone/Qdrant metadata filters now emits at least one finding pinned on CWE-943 + OWASP LLM08:2025 with mitigations covering pre-retrieval filtering, base filter pinning, namespace-per-tenant, and allowlisted clause keys.
- **Cat 2 Package-Manager / CI-Workflow keyword extension** — the existing Server-Side Execution Sinks category now triggers on `npm install`, `pip install`, `apt install`, `brew install`, `gh workflow`, `actions/`, `uses:`, `package-lock`, `requirements.txt` keywords (when paired with a downstream execution-sink indicator). Anchored on SANDWORM_MODE npm worm (2025-09 → 2026-04), LiteLLM PyPI compromise (2026-03), and arXiv 2605.07135 Agentic Workflow Injection.
- **Cross-Agent Handoff Sinks navigational subsection** disambiguates the boundary between `output-integrity` (output-handling), `tool-abuse` (tool-argument handoff, ASI04 / LLM06), and `data-poisoning` (durable-memory-write, ASI06 — *not* LLM04). Includes the Memory-Promotion Rules schema seed (`promotable_keys` + `value_schema` + `tenant_scope`) anchored on OWASP ASI06, AWS Bedrock AgentCore Memory, and Vertex AI Memory Bank.
- **multi-tenant-rag-app baseline** (`examples/multi-tenant-rag-app/architecture.md`) exercising the Cat 6 sink in a Mermaid-rendered architecture description; added to the standardized examples table.
- **ADR-045 governance artefact** with 8-decision structure, 8-ADR cross-reference matrix (021/023/027/028/030/032/034/035), and ADR-031 D8 asymmetry note. 8th Heuristic A enrichment execution per ADR-032 lineage.
- **F-292 carve-out in `tests/scripts/test_backward_compatibility.py`** (T035) — same-shape extension to the F-241 precedent; moves `output-integrity.md` out of `DETECTION_AGENT_PATHS` and adds `detection-patterns.md` to `DETECTION_PATTERN_REF_ENRICHMENT_HOSTS`.

## How to See & Test

1. **Read the new Cat 6 worked example**: open `.claude/skills/tachi-output-integrity/references/detection-patterns.md` and scroll to "Cat 6 (Vector / Search-DSL Injection)" — the worked example names Pinecone metadata-filter omission of `tenant_id` clause as the canonical OI-{N} finding.
2. **Verify Cat 2 keyword extension**: in the same file, locate "Cat 2 (Server-Side Execution Sinks)" Trigger Keywords list and confirm the `npm install`/`pip install`/`gh workflow`/`actions/`/`uses:` additions are present (additive-only edit; prior keywords byte-identical).
3. **Read the Cross-Agent Handoff Sinks subsection**: navigate to the subsection placed after Cat 6. Confirm: (a) boundary phrase "harmless as text, dangerous as tool argument or memory entry", (b) explicit no-emission statement, (c) cross-links to `tool-abuse.md` and `data-poisoning.md`, (d) Memory-Promotion Rules YAML schema with the three required fields.
4. **Inspect ADR-045**: `docs/architecture/02_ADRs/ADR-045-output-integrity-cross-sink-refinement.md` — confirm `Status: Accepted`, `Accepted-commit-SHA: 0629fa2`, 8-decision body, and 8-ADR cross-reference matrix.
5. **Run the multi-tenant-rag-app baseline**: `tachi.threat-model examples/multi-tenant-rag-app/architecture.md` — expect at least one `output-integrity` finding with Pinecone-specific Cat 6 terminology (post-merge `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000` byte-identical reproduction is part of T020/T026 follow-up).
6. **Run the byte-identical regression suite**: `python3 -m pytest tests/scripts/test_backward_compatibility.py` — expect 13 passed / 1 documented skip; confirms SC-004 (5 non-qualifying baselines byte-identical) and SC-010 (zero-edit invariant F-292 carve-out).
7. **Verify cross-agent navigational invariant (SC-003)**: re-run `tachi.threat-model examples/agentic-app/architecture.md` and diff the OI-scoped finding subset against the pre-292 baseline under `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000`. Expected: byte-identical OI-scoped subset (no new emissions from the navigational prose).
8. **Verify community attribution chain**: read [discussion #179](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/discussions/179) for the two-choice offer reply (T005), and verify the post-merge delivery comment (T022) names each of the three gap closures with anchor links.

## Delivery Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Estimated Duration | 1-2 days |
| Actual Duration | 1 day (same-day spec → plan → build → deliver) |
| Variance | On-target (within estimate window; docs-only enrichment with no schema/orchestrator surface change) |

---

## Surprise Log

A lot of postponed tasks — 11 of 36 tasks remained `[ ]` at /aod.deliver entry, all MANUAL-ONLY post-merge or SLA-driven (T005 discussion offer, T017 cross-link no-emission verification, T019–T024 community-engagement and release-please loop, T026 auto-pipeline artifacts, T031 ADR-045 SHA fill, T034 this /aod.deliver invocation). The build-vs-deliver split was clear in hindsight but produced an over-large "incomplete" count at deliver-time triage.

---

## Lessons Learned

| Category | Lesson | KB Entry |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Process improvement | Move post-merge community-engagement and SLA-driven tasks into a dedicated follow-up issue at /aod.deliver time to (1) keep the closing feature's Issue cleanly transitioning to `stage:done`, (2) create real accountability for SLA-driven actions, (3) enable /schedule or cron follow-ups against a stable Issue number. | Entry 7 in INSTITUTIONAL_KNOWLEDGE.md |

KB Entry 6 (added during build via T033) captures the companion build-time lesson: enrichment-branch features that modify detection-tier files MUST update the F-142 zero-edit invariant test in the same change.

---

## Feedback Loop

**New Ideas**: None

No new ideas surfaced from the retrospective. The post-merge tail (T020/T022/T023/T024/T031) is tracked via the existing tasks.md surface and will be addressed in the standard /aod.deliver follow-up cycle.

## Test Evidence

### Test Scenarios (Living Documentation)

| AC ID | Given/When/Then | Scenario(s) | Status |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| US1-AC-1 | Given Qdrant must/must_not filter from LLM → When tachi.threat-model runs → Then OI finding with CWE-943 + LLM08:2025 emits | quickstart §10 verification (post-merge) | Manual |
| US1-AC-2 | Given Pinecone metadata filter from LLM → When threat-model runs → Then Pinecone-specific Cat 6 finding emits | quickstart §10 verification (post-merge) | Manual |
| US1-AC-3 | Given architecture with no LLM-synthesized query → When threat-model runs → Then zero new Cat 6 findings (no FP) | T018 + T030 §10 | Covered |
| US2-AC-1 | Given LLM emitting `npm install <attacker>` + execution sink → When threat-model runs → Then Cat 2 sub-example finding emits | quickstart §11 verification (post-merge) | Manual |
| US3-AC-1 | Given architecture with tool-call handoff + memory-write → When threat-model runs → Then output-integrity emits zero new findings (navigational only) | T017 + T018 cross-link no-emission | Manual |

**Totals**: 5 ACs surfaced — 1 Covered (byte-identical regression), 4 Manual (require post-merge `tachi.threat-model` invocation).

This is a docs-only enrichment feature — no Gherkin scenarios were authored. Verification is via static grep checks (T030 §1-§9, all PASS) and post-merge `tachi.threat-model` runs against the new `multi-tenant-rag-app` baseline + the 5 non-qualifying baselines.

### Execution Evidence

#### E2E Validation Gate

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Status | skipped |
| Gate Mode | skipped-via-scope (docs-only refinement; no Playwright surface) |
| Gate Result | skip |
| Tests Passed | N/A |
| Tests Failed | N/A |
| Tests Skipped | N/A |
| Duration | N/A |

**Failure Details**: E2E validation skipped — feature is a docs-only enrichment of agent reference files and ADRs. No frontend/backend code surface to exercise via Playwright. The byte-identical regression suite (`test_backward_compatibility.py`) is the appropriate test gate and passed 13/14 (1 documented skip).

#### Command

```bash
/aod.deliver 292
```

#### Build-Wave Test Results

| Wave | Tests | Passed | Failed | Status |
|------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| (all) | 0 | 0 | 0 | skip |

**Build Summary**: 0/3 waves tested — docs-only refinement (markdown + YAML schema example only). Post-wave test execution per /aod.build Step 4.5a skipped uniformly. (Source: `specs/292-output-integrity-cross-sink-refinement/test-results/summary.json`)

#### Backward-Compatibility Regression (out-of-band)

Run during build phase via `python3 -m pytest tests/scripts/test_backward_compatibility.py`:

- **Tests Run**: 14
- **Passed**: 13
- **Skipped**: 1 (documented skip — pre-existing baseline marker)
- **Failed**: 0
- **Coverage**: SC-004 (5 baselines byte-identical) ✅; SC-010 (zero-edit invariant F-292 carve-out) ✅

#### Artifacts

| Artifact | Path | Summary |
|----------|------|---------|
| security-scan | specs/292-output-integrity-cross-sink-refinement/security-scan.md | T029 PASS — SAST + SCA both SKIPPED (0 code files, 0 manifests); scan_id 81f2eb2d-0e96-4130-a956-d7f4cd264937 |
| build-summary | specs/292-output-integrity-cross-sink-refinement/test-results/summary.json | 0/3 waves tested (docs-only) |
| spec | specs/292-output-integrity-cross-sink-refinement/spec.md | Full feature specification with 5 user stories + 12 SCs + 7 NFRs |
| plan | specs/292-output-integrity-cross-sink-refinement/plan.md | Implementation plan with Q1-Q5 resolutions |
| tasks | specs/292-output-integrity-cross-sink-refinement/tasks.md | 36 tasks (25 [X], 11 [ ] MANUAL-ONLY/POST-MERGE) |

**Archived Artifact Metrics**:
- Tests Run: 14 (backward-compatibility regression suite)
- Passed: 13
- Failed: 0
- Coverage: SC-004 + SC-010 satisfied empirically

**Notes**: Docs-only feature; no E2E surface. Backward-compatibility regression suite is the canonical test gate. T029 security re-scan PASS (no code surface to scan).
