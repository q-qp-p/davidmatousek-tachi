## Completed This Session (Pre-T021 + W12-W14)

- **`86a868e`** `docs(277): AC-7 disambiguation probe (Option A) — ANOMALY confirmed` — pre-T021 NEXT-SESSION.md D-1 resolution
  - Per user-confirmed Option A: live `WebFetch(https://gist.github.com/)` against an UNLISTED github subdomain — harness AUTO-APPROVED. Because `gist.github.com` is NOT in `.permissions.allow[]` (only 7 github-family explicit entries: github.com, api.github.com, raw.githubusercontent.com, githubusercontent.com, objects.githubusercontent.com, codeload.github.com, github.io), the auto-approve can ONLY be explained by parent rule `WebFetch(domain:github.com)` transitively matching the unlisted subdomain. **Conclusive: AC-7 ANOMALY confirmed — subdomain transitive collapse IS happening.** Contradicts upstream Issues #15260, #11972, #1217 (non-transitive matching reports at filing time). 19-domain list still functions as defense-in-depth; 7 github-family entries subsumed by parent github.com rule. Compaction is now an open follow-up option (T028 family). F-4 unaffected per plan §D-5.
  - Updates: tasks.md T018 build-stage capture appended with Post-W11 Option A disambiguation addendum; PR #278 body line 35 flipped from PROBE-INCONCLUSIVE-FOR-TRANSITIVITY to ANOMALY; Side observations rewritten with two-stage probe narrative (pushed via `gh pr edit`).

- **W12 T021** PASS (commit `c99c46d` — post-merge): `gh pr ready 278` succeeded; `isDraft=false`, `state=OPEN`, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, title preserved with `feat(277):` prefix. Gate C (all-pre-commit-verifications-green) satisfied 10/10.

- **W13 T022** PASS (squash commit `896588b`, no docs commit on branch — T022 capture written post-merge on main): `gh pr merge 278 --squash` succeeded; PR transitioned to `state=MERGED`, `mergedAt=2026-05-09T16:24:37Z`, `mergeCommit=896588b`. Squash subject on main: `896588b feat(277): claude permissions baseline (BLP-02 F-4) (#278)` — Conventional Commit prefix preserved (release-please trigger intact per F-212 incident memory). Notable side-signal: `release-please--branches--main` got a forced update during the post-merge `git pull`, confirming bot processed the squash in real-time. **Process deviation note**: T021 build-stage capture was modified locally on the branch but not committed to branch tip pre-squash; therefore not included in squash content. Stashed on branch, applied on main post-merge; T021+T022+T023 captures bundled in single `docs(277):` post-delivery commit `c99c46d` (acceptable per `.claude/rules/git-workflow.md` hidden-bump rule).

- **W14 T023** PASS (commit `c99c46d` — captured with T021/T022): release-please PR #279 `chore(main): release 4.34.0` opened at 16:25:00Z (~23s post-T022, within FR-013 ~30s SLO). F-3 v4.33.0 already released 2026-05-08, target v4.34.0 confirms expected version bump. F-212 recovery flow (empty release-marker) NOT triggered.

- **W14 T024** PASS (commits `d2eeedd security(277):` + `be41e5e docs(277):` — split per skill Step 7): `/security` re-scan post-merge invoked at HEAD `c99c46d0bab9`. Strict protocol `git diff --name-only main...HEAD` from main: empty diff (we are on main post-squash) → SAST `SKIPPED` + SCA `SKIPPED` → Step 5c clean-scan → status=PASSED. Supplementary inspection of squash content (`HEAD~2...HEAD~1`) confirmed F-4 contains zero SAST-eligible files (`.py .js .ts .jsx .tsx .sh .go .rs .java .rb .swift .kt .php .cs .cpp .c .h` — none in 15-file change set: `.claude/settings.json`, `.gitignore`, `CHANGELOG.md`, 5 `docs/*.md`, 7 `specs/*.md`) and zero SCA-eligible manifests. **Artifacts written**: `.security/scan-log.jsonl` chain_hash continuity (prev `337228462bfa` from F-3 → new `81a9e8c6c660`); `.security/reports/c99c46d0bab9.sarif` (empty `results[]` + scan-context properties); `specs/277-claude-permissions-baseline/security-scan.md` (full report with diff-base rationale + 15-file table). FR-014 satisfied.

## Current State

- **Phase**: implement
- **Tasks**: 24/30 complete (W1-W14). Remaining: T025-T028 (Wave 15) + T029-T030 (deferred to `/aod.deliver`).
- **Uncommitted**: clean (all W14 work pushed to main: `c99c46d` docs + `d2eeedd` security + `be41e5e` docs).
- **Branch state**: on `main`. Feature branch `277-claude-permissions-baseline` retained locally + on remote (not auto-deleted by gh pr merge — squash --delete-branch flag NOT passed). May be cleaned up post-W15.
- **GitHub Issue**: #277 — still in `Build` board column from W1; will move to `Delivered` at /aod.deliver-time (T029).
- **Triad sign-offs**: PM ✓ + Architect ✓ + Team-Lead ⚠ APPROVED_WITH_CONCERNS (recorded in tasks.md frontmatter).
- **All Open Decisions resolved**: D-1 closed via Option A ANOMALY-confirmed (`86a868e` + tasks.md T018 addendum + PR #278 body update); D-2 + D-3 already accepted in prior session.

## Next Actions

### Wave 15 — Defense-in-depth + follow-up Issues (T025-T028)

Final implement wave. T025-T026 [MANUAL-ONLY] [P] require a fresh post-merge Claude Code session loaded with the merged `.claude/settings.json`. T027-T028 [P] are simple `gh issue create` calls and can run in any session.

#### T025-T026 [MANUAL-ONLY] [P] — Post-merge defense-in-depth re-runs

In a **fresh Claude Code session** in this repo (loaded with the merged `.claude/settings.json` from main HEAD):

- **T025** (AC-6b re-run): Attempt `Bash(git status)`. Expected: auto-approve (no prompt). If a prompt surfaces or denies, the merged settings have a regression — investigate before declaring W15 complete.

- **T026** (AC-6c re-run): Attempt `Bash(git push --force origin <test-branch>)` against a throwaway test branch. Expected: deny prompt surfaces (cross-list precedence: broader `git push:*` allow does NOT shadow narrower `git push --force:*` deny). If auto-approves, the deny rule was lost in the squash-merge — investigate.

These re-runs guard against squash-merge regressions beyond the pre-commit T009/T010 verifications. Capture outcomes inline in tasks.md T025/T026 build-stage capture sections.

#### T027 [P] — File AC-15 follow-up Issue

```bash
gh issue create --title "[chore] Pre-commit hook for .claude/settings.json + CLAUDE_PERMISSIONS.md AC-2 cross-check (post-F-4 follow-up)" --body "Pre-commit hook running 'jq empty .claude/settings.json' + AC-2 cross-check (every non-built-in rule documented in CLAUDE_PERMISSIONS.md per-rule table) on edits touching either file. Origin: F-4 (PRD AC-15 nice-to-have, deferred at /aod.spec). Captures JSON-validity regressions and orphan-rule regressions before commit. Hook should inherit the awk-section-marker AC-2 form codified in PR #278 (architect P1 Minor #2 reconciliation in ec0b628). ICE rough estimate: I:5 C:7 E:8."
```

Capture issue number in tasks.md T027 build-stage capture.

#### T028 [P] — File AC-16 follow-up Issue

Per tasks.md T028 body: file an Issue tracking CI integration for the verification recipe. Suggested addition (per Option A finding from this session): note that the conclusive AC-7 ANOMALY finding opens a list-compaction option for the 7 github-family explicit entries — this could be folded into T028 (CI verification) or filed as a sibling T028b. Decide at filing time.

```bash
gh issue create --title "[chore] CI integration for F-4 verification recipe (post-F-4 follow-up)" --body "<see tasks.md T028 body for canonical text>. **Optional addition**: Per F-4 W11 T018 + post-W11 Option A disambiguation probe (gist.github.com auto-approved → AC-7 ANOMALY confirmed, subdomain transitive collapse IS happening), the 19-domain WebFetch allow list has 7 github-family entries (api.github.com, raw.githubusercontent.com, githubusercontent.com, objects.githubusercontent.com, codeload.github.com, github.io) that are subsumed by the parent WebFetch(domain:github.com) rule via transitive collapse. Compaction option opens — could be folded into the CI verification scope or filed as sibling Issue. ICE rough estimate (CI integration only): I:6 C:6 E:7."
```

#### W15 commit cadence

Bundle all W15 captures into a single `docs(277):` commit on main (post-delivery hidden-bump per `.claude/rules/git-workflow.md`):

```bash
git add specs/277-claude-permissions-baseline/tasks.md
git commit -m "docs(277): W15 build-stage captures (T025 T026 T027 T028)"
git push origin main
```

### Wave (deferred) — `/aod.deliver`-time governance closure (T029-T030)

After W15 completes, run `/aod.deliver` to:

- **T029**: Flip `docs/product/02_PRD/INDEX.md` row 277 status `Approved` → `Delivered` + append squash-merge PR link `https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/pull/278` and merge timestamp `2026-05-09T16:24:37Z`.

- **T030**: Update `~/.claude/projects/-Users-david-Projects-tachi/memory/project_blp02_enterprise_hardening.md` to reflect Wave 4 → DELIVERED 4-of-5 + append F-4 closure date `2026-05-09` and squash-commit `896588b` + release-please PR #279.

Plus `/aod.deliver` standard steps:
- Move Issue #277 from `Build` → `Delivered` board column
- Verify release-please PR #279 (or its successor with bundled features) is in good shape
- Per BLP-02 status: this is **4-of-5** delivered. Remaining BLP-02 feature: F-5 (TBD per project_blp02_enterprise_hardening.md).
- Optionally clean up local + remote `277-claude-permissions-baseline` branch:
  ```bash
  git branch -d 277-claude-permissions-baseline
  git push origin --delete 277-claude-permissions-baseline
  ```

## Resume Command

```bash
claude "Resume F-4 Claude Code Permissions Baseline final wave (W15). Branch: main (post-squash-merge at 896588b). Waves 1-14 complete (24/30 tasks). Run /aod.build to continue with Wave 15 — T025-T026 [MANUAL-ONLY] post-merge defense-in-depth re-runs (Bash(git status) auto-approve + Bash(git push --force) deny prompt) in this session loaded with merged .claude/settings.json + T027-T028 follow-up Issue filing (gh issue create for AC-15 pre-commit hook + AC-16 CI integration with optional AC-7 ANOMALY compaction note). Then /aod.deliver for T029-T030 + Issue/board closure + branch cleanup."
```

Or simply:

```bash
/aod.build
```

— `/aod.build` will detect this NEXT-SESSION.md and confirm resume prerequisites before continuing.

---

## Open Decisions

**None blocking.** All three NEXT-SESSION.md decisions from prior session resolved:

- ✅ D-1 (AC-7 disambiguation): Option A executed pre-T021 — ANOMALY confirmed (`86a868e`); compaction is an open follow-up option captured in T028 body addition above.
- ✅ D-2 (ADR-041 LOC overage): accepted with PR #278 Summary note (recorded for traceability only, no further action).
- ✅ D-3 (T011/T012 partial live coverage): accepted (recorded for traceability only, no further action).

---

## Session Achievements Summary

This session executed **Pre-T021 + 3 waves (W12, W13, W14)** in standalone mode:

- Pre-T021: AC-7 disambiguation probe (Option A) → ANOMALY confirmed; tasks.md + PR body updated; commit `86a868e` pushed
- W12: T021 PR-ready transition — `isDraft=false`, Gate C 10/10 satisfied
- W13: T022 squash-merge PR #278 → main at `896588b` — Conventional Commit subject preserved
- W14: T023 release-please PR #279 v4.34.0 opened ~23s post-merge — within SLO; T024 /security re-scan PASSED — no new HIGH/MEDIUM findings, FR-014 satisfied

5 commits pushed to main (`86a868e` was on branch pre-merge; `c99c46d` + `d2eeedd` + `be41e5e` post-merge on main; `896588b` is the squash itself). 4 of 5 remote pushes triggered "Bypassed rule violations" admin-override warnings (expected per `.claude/rules/git-workflow.md` for `docs(NNN):` and `security(NNN):` post-delivery commits on main).

Remaining: 1 wave (W15: 4 tasks) + /aod.deliver-time closure (T029-T030 + Issue/board) → F-4 fully closed → BLP-02 4-of-5 → BLP-03 (signed updates) trigger condition partially met (BLP-02 closure pending F-5).

---

## Wave Continuation Rationale

This session executed 3 waves (W12, W13, W14) in standalone mode, hitting the `/aod.build` 3-wave ceiling per build skill wave continuation rule. Resume at Wave 15 in next session. Build skill protocol: "Stop and hand off if `orchestrated == false` AND this conversation has executed 3 or more waves." Last wave exception (proceed past ceiling on final wave) does not apply because the ceiling check happens AFTER each wave — at end-of-W14, 3 waves done → STOP. W15 is the final implement wave but starts fresh next session.
