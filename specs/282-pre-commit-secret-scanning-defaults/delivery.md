## 1. Definition of Done

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| All tasks complete (build-time T001-T029) | PASS — 30/30 marked [X] |
| T030 PR title verify + ready + squash-merge | PASS — `feat(282): pre-commit secret-scanning defaults` |
| T031 release-please verification | PASS — PR #284 opened within 60s (no marker needed) |

| Documentation agents APPROVED | PASS — PM + Architect + DevOps (10 doc files updated) |

---

## 2. Delivery Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Estimated Duration | Same-day (Saturday 2026-05-10 per PRD A-5 + Team-Lead 12-15h envelope) |
| Actual Duration | ~4h wall-clock active build (branch creation 2026-05-10 10:15 EDT → squash-merge 14:19 EDT) |
| Issue-to-delivery | ~20.5 hours (Issue #282 opened 2026-05-09 17:54 EDT → delivered 2026-05-10 14:19 EDT) |
| Tasks complete | 30/37 build-phase + T030 + T031 (delivery-time); T032-T036 in flight |
| File surface | 8 new files + 5 deltas + 16 fixture files + 1 test runner + 1 pytest test ≈ 4,410 insertions / 8 deletions |

## 3. Surprise Log

**Smooth sailing — no surprises.**

Plan + Wave-Sequencing held throughout. Wave 5 entry-gate required regenerating `tests/fixtures/init-baseline-tree/` to absorb F-3 + F-4 doc drift (commit `be9c81a`) but this was anticipated as a routine fixture-freshness step, not a build surprise.

---

## 4. Lessons Learned

User opted to skip lesson capture during retrospective. Build-wave verification artifacts in `.aod/results/` (T017, T019, T020, T028, T029) carry the empirical evidence; no narrative lesson is recorded in `docs/INSTITUTIONAL_KNOWLEDGE.md` for F-5.

---

## 5. New Ideas

**None** — emergent follow-ups are fully captured by T033 (3 post-merge Issues filed during /aod.deliver):

| Follow-up | Trigger | Type |
|-----------|---------|------|
| AC-18 rule-coverage probe | PRD Q3 + AC-18 | enhancement |
| AC-19 adopter-extensibility template (`.gitleaks.toml.adopter-template`) | PRD Q3 + AC-19 | enhancement |
| Pin-bump cadence accountability (per Architect CONCERN-4) | Architect CONCERN-4 carry-forward | maintenance |

---

## 6. Test Evidence

### CI PR Checks (commit `49f4bcc`, PR #283)

| Check | Conclusion | Duration |
|-------|------------|----------|
| `gitleaks` | PASS | 3s |
| `gitleaks full-repo scan` | PASS | 20s |
| `Verify preflight gate fires when mmdc is absent` | PASS | 12s |
| `pytest init.sh suite — ubuntu-latest` | PASS | 6m54s |
| `pytest init.sh suite — macos-latest` | PASS | 17m41s |

### Build-Wave Test Results

| Wave | Tests | Passed | Failed | Status |
|------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| wave-01 (Foundation) | gate not fired | — | — | skipped (verification-focused build) |
| wave-02 (Verification) | gate not fired | — | — | skipped |
| wave-03 (init.sh + CI) | gate not fired | — | — | skipped |
| wave-04 (Docs + ADR) | gate not fired | — | — | skipped |
| wave-05 (Delivery) | gate not fired | — | — | skipped |

**Build Summary**: skipped overall — Per `specs/282-*/test-results/summary.json`, the per-wave automated test gate (skill Step 4.5) did not fire in this /aod.build invocation. Wave 5 was verification-focused and CI-level regression coverage is provided by the `tachi-pytest.yml` workflow on every push — GREEN at Wave 5 close-out (CI runs 25635050102 + 25635117861, both ubuntu + macos PASS).

### Manual Wave 5 Pre-Merge Verification (T029)

| Dimension | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| AC-4 baseline (`pre-commit run --all-files` zero findings) | PASS — `.aod/results/ac4-baseline-zero-findings.md` |
| AC-SPEC-1 fixture matrix (16/16 expected) | PASS — `tests/fixtures/gitleaks-rule-interaction/run.sh` |
| 6/6 pytest matrix cases | PASS — `tests/scripts/test_init_precommit_matrix.py` (5 PASS + 1 [MANUAL-ONLY] SKIP) |
| FR-007 CI parity bad-credential push + cleanup | PASS — `.aod/results/t028-ci-parity-bad-credential-verification.md` |
| AC-10 reviewer cross-check (PRECOMMIT_HOOKS.md per-rule catalog ↔ .gitleaks.toml) | PASS — `.aod/results/wave5-pre-merge-verification.md` |

### E2E Validation Gate

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Status | `error` (gracefully — not a hard-block) |
| Reason | `stacks/knowledge-system/STACK.md` has no `aod-test-contract` block (lint exit 5) |
| Stack pack | `knowledge-system` |
| Hard-block | NO — `--require-tests` not set; gate is informational per ADR-006 |
| Rationale | Knowledge-system pack does not declare an E2E contract. Test evidence comes from build-wave pytest + manual verification + CI parity workflow. |
