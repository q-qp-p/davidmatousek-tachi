## Reference Patterns: Template-Maintenance CI Workflows

This section documents the reference CI workflows that the upstream template uses to protect its own release-tooling integrity. **None ship to adopter projects** — adopt them only if you extend the template and want the same guarantees.

| Workflow | Feature | Protects |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `.github/workflows/manifest-coverage.yml` | F129 (downstream template update) | File-ownership invariant for `.aod/template-manifest.txt` |
| `.github/workflows/extract-coverage.yml` | F128 (directory-based extraction manifest) | Classification-snapshot invariant for `scripts/extract-classification.txt` |
| `.github/workflows/stack-contract.yml` | F130 (Stack Pack Test Contract) | Test contract invariant for every `stacks/*/STACK.md` (excluding content-pack allowlist) |
| `.github/workflows/tachi-mmdc-preflight.yml` | F145 (Mermaid CLI hard-prerequisite) | Loud-failure path when `mmdc` is absent on the runner (ADR-022) |
| `.github/workflows/tachi-pytest.yml` | F-248 (Substitution surface hardening) | `scripts/init.sh` substitution behaviour on a macOS+Ubuntu pytest matrix (ADR-038) |
| `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml` | F-282 / F-5 (Pre-commit secret-scanning defaults) | Full-repo gitleaks scan on PR — back-stop for `git commit --no-verify` (ADR-042) |

The first three workflows share the bash:3.2 Docker pattern, SHA-pinned checkout action, `contents: read` permissions, and cancel-in-progress concurrency. The latter three (`tachi-mmdc-preflight.yml`, `tachi-pytest.yml`, `gitleaks.yml`) follow a different pattern — direct host-runner execution with path-filtered triggers (or unfiltered, in `gitleaks.yml`'s case) — because their workloads (`mmdc` Node binary preflight, Python+bash subprocess tests, native gitleaks binary) do not benefit from container isolation. Use any of the first three as a template when adding a new maintenance workflow that needs the bash:3.2 floor; use `tachi-pytest.yml` as a template when adding a new path-filtered Python test job; use `gitleaks.yml` as a template when adding a new SARIF-emitting scanner job.

### Shared Workflow Conventions

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Runner | `ubuntu-latest` |
| Execution shell | `bash:3.2` Docker image (matches macOS workstation floor) |
| Permissions | `contents: read` (principle of least privilege) |
| Concurrency | `cancel-in-progress: true` on same ref (force-push safe) |
| Action pinning | `actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683` (v4.2.2) pinned by SHA, NOT tag |
| Trigger | `push` and `pull_request` against `main` (stack-contract adds a `paths:` filter — see F130 subsection) |

### Manifest Coverage Workflow (F129)

`.github/workflows/manifest-coverage.yml` enforces that every tracked file in the repo appears in `.aod/template-manifest.txt` (either with an explicit ownership rule or as an `ignore` entry).

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Workflow file | `.github/workflows/manifest-coverage.yml` |
| Validator script | `scripts/check-manifest-coverage.sh` (bash 3.2 compatible) |
| Local invocation | `scripts/check-manifest-coverage.sh` |

**Exit contract**:

| Exit | Meaning | Stderr |
|------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Every `git ls-files` entry matches a manifest entry | (empty) |
| 1 | Manifest missing, malformed, or any file uncategorized | `<path>:1: uncategorized (no manifest entry or ignore match)` per offending file (compiler-diagnostic format — GitHub Actions annotators parse it automatically) |

### Extract Coverage Workflow (F128)

**Added in Feature 128** (directory-based extraction manifest).

`.github/workflows/extract-coverage.yml` enforces the classification-snapshot invariant required by feature 128's 5-layer defense against private-data leak: every git-tracked file must be classified in the committed `scripts/extract-classification.txt` snapshot, and the classification must match what the current `MANIFEST_DIRS` / `MANIFEST_ROOT_FILES` / `.extractignore` configuration would produce. Divergence blocks the PR.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Workflow file | `.github/workflows/extract-coverage.yml` |
| Validator script | `scripts/check-extract-coverage.sh` (bash 3.2 compatible) |
| Snapshot artifact | `scripts/extract-classification.txt` (committed, sorted) |
| Local invocation (validate) | `make extract-check` |
| Local invocation (regenerate) | `make extract-classify` |
| Workflow name | `Extract Coverage` |
| Job ID | `check-extract-coverage` |
| Concurrency group | `extract-coverage-${{ github.ref }}` |

**Exit contract**:

| Exit | Meaning | Stderr |
|------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Snapshot matches reality (or emergency override triggered) | (empty) |
| 1 | Snapshot missing, malformed, or diverged from computed classification | `extract-classification.txt:1: <message>: <path>` per divergence (compiler-diagnostic format) |

**Classification values** (per `specs/128-directory-based-extraction-manifest/data-model.md` Entity 3):

- `SHIP` — file ships downstream (covered by MANIFEST_DIRS / MANIFEST_ROOT_FILES, not excluded by `.extractignore`)
- `EXCL-by-override` — covered by MANIFEST but excluded by `.extractignore`
- `EXCL-by-construction` — not covered by MANIFEST at all (private-by-default)

**Emergency override** (FR-018): include the literal marker `[skip extract-check]` in the head commit message to bypass the check for a single commit. The workflow emits a `::warning::` annotation on skip so the override is visible in the Actions log. Use sparingly — guidance in `docs/guides/PLSK_MAINTAINER_GUIDE.md` caps routine use at "no more than once per quarter" (PM Decision).

**Full contract**: `specs/128-directory-based-extraction-manifest/contracts/classification-snapshot.md` and `contracts/extract-cli.md`.

### Stack Contract Workflow (F130)

**Added in Feature 130** (Stack Pack Test Contract), merged via PR #141 on 2026-04-21.

`.github/workflows/stack-contract.yml` enforces that every app-stack pack's `stacks/*/STACK.md` contains a valid, machine-readable test-contract block between the `<!-- BEGIN: aod-test-contract -->` / `<!-- END: aod-test-contract -->` sentinels. This guarantees the AOD test-orchestration pipeline can discover a deterministic test command for every active stack pack without falling back to heuristics. The workflow runs on push/PR to `main` and blocks the PR on any lint violation.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Workflow file | `.github/workflows/stack-contract.yml` |
| Validator script | `.aod/scripts/bash/stack-contract-lint.sh` (bash 3.2 compatible) |
| Invocation (CI) | `bash .aod/scripts/bash/stack-contract-lint.sh --all` |
| Local invocation (single pack) | `bash .aod/scripts/bash/stack-contract-lint.sh stacks/<pack>/STACK.md` |
| Local invocation (all packs) | `bash .aod/scripts/bash/stack-contract-lint.sh --all` |
| Workflow name | `Stack Contract` |
| Job ID | `check` |
| Concurrency group | `stack-contract-${{ github.ref }}` |
| Path filter | `stacks/**/STACK.md`, `.aod/scripts/bash/stack-contract-lint.sh`, `.github/workflows/stack-contract.yml`, `tests/fixtures/stack-contracts/**` |

**Exit contract** (stable forever — do not repurpose):

| Exit | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | `VALID` — all non-allowlisted packs have a well-formed contract block |
| 1 | `RUNTIME_ERROR` — missing dependencies, filesystem error, or invalid invocation |
| 2 | `MISSING_TEST_COMMAND` — `test_command` key absent, or `e2e_opt_out` rationale below minimum length |
| 3 | `XOR_VIOLATION` — both `test_command` and `e2e_opt_out` present (mutually exclusive) |
| 4 | `UNKNOWN_KEY` — contract block contains a key outside the allowed schema |
| 5 | `MISSING_BLOCK` — no `<!-- BEGIN: aod-test-contract -->` / `<!-- END: aod-test-contract -->` sentinels found |

In `--all` mode the script exits with the **numerically lowest non-zero code** across all non-allowlisted packs so the failing-fast diagnostic stays deterministic across CI and local runs (per FR-030 byte-identical stderr).

**Content-pack allowlist**: Packs listed in the script's `CONTENT_PACKS` array (currently `knowledge-system`) are skipped in `--all` mode because they carry no runnable tests. Single-file mode ignores the allowlist so maintainers can still lint a pack explicitly when intentionally transitioning it from content-only to test-bearing.

**Local-parity guarantee**: `stack-contract-lint.sh` is strictly bash-3.2 clean (no associative arrays, no `readarray`, no case-modification parameter expansion) so it runs on stock macOS `/bin/bash` 3.2.57 without any shim. Combined with the `bash:3.2` Docker image used in CI, stderr output is byte-identical between a developer's workstation and the GitHub Actions runner (modulo runner path prefixes). See KB Entry 6 for why this floor matters.

**Full contract**: `specs/130-e2e-hard-gate/contracts/stack-contract-lint.md` and `docs/stacks/TEST_COMMAND_CONTRACT.md`. The STACK.md block schema is defined in `specs/130-e2e-hard-gate/data-model.md` §1, §2, §5.

**Feature 142 Update (2026-04-23)**: The workflow itself (`.github/workflows/stack-contract.yml`) and the validator (`.aod/scripts/bash/stack-contract-lint.sh`) are **unchanged** by F142 (PR #151) — the exit-code contract (0–5) was already strict as of F130. F142 only removes the grace-period fallback that previously lived inside `/aod.deliver` Step 9a, which translated a lint exit 5 (MISSING_BLOCK) into a silent skip. Post-F142, `/aod.deliver` surfaces exit 5 as an explicit error with the lint stderr diagnostic shown verbatim in the delivery report. **Effective impact on CI consumers**: any pipeline that parses delivery.md rendered by `/aod.deliver` should read `e2e_validation.status` (`error` vs. `skipped` vs. `success`) from the payload rather than pattern-matching grace-period language in the human-readable rendering. The stack-contract CI workflow continues to fail any PR that would have tripped its exit 5 anyway — F142 closes the same gap at the `/aod.deliver` boundary for branches not guarded by the CI workflow. PRD: `docs/product/02_PRD/142-remove-grace-period-fallback-2026-04-23.md`.

### Tachi Pytest Workflow (F-248 + F-250 + F-256 + F-282)

**Added in Feature 248** (Substitution Surface Hardening), merged via PR #249 (squash commit `6db9a25`) on 2026-05-04. Re-tuned and re-scoped by Feature 250 (PR #253, squash `75866d9`) on 2026-05-04 (timeouts + session-scoped fixture). Extended by Feature 256 (PR #257, squash `f959622`) on 2026-05-05 to cover the source-pattern-hardening surface. Extended by Feature 282 / F-5 (PR #283, squash `18378bd`) on 2026-05-10 to wire `tests/scripts/test_init_precommit_matrix.py` into both the `paths:` trigger and the pytest invocation in lock-step (the F-256 lock-step pattern, applied verbatim).

`.github/workflows/tachi-pytest.yml` runs the combined F-248 substitution test suite + F-256 source-pattern-hardening test suite on a 2-runner cross-platform matrix (`macos-latest` + `ubuntu-latest`) to catch bash-version regressions across the full bash surface area: `scripts/init.sh`, `.aod/scripts/bash/template-substitute.sh`, `.aod/scripts/bash/init-input.sh`, `.aod/scripts/bash/template-git.sh`, `.aod/scripts/bash/template-config-load.sh` (F-256 canonical KV-load primitive), the constitution templates, and the shipped stack-pack `defaults.env` files (F-256 Site A whitelist surface). The macOS leg is the strictest gate because it ships bash 3.2.57 (Apple's bundled `/bin/bash`, GPLv3-pinned) — a green macOS run on top of a green Ubuntu run proves the entire hardening surface is portable, not bash-3.2-quirk-locked.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Workflow file | `.github/workflows/tachi-pytest.yml` |
| Trigger | `pull_request` only (path-filtered — see below) |
| Runners | `macos-latest`, `ubuntu-latest` (matrix, `fail-fast: false`) |
| Python version | 3.11 (matches `tachi-mmdc-preflight.yml` baseline) |
| Permissions | `contents: read` |
| Pip dependencies | `pytest>=8`, `pytest-timeout>=2`, `pyyaml>=6` |
| Inner subprocess timeout | 900s (in `tests/scripts/init_sh_helpers.run_init_in_clone`, F-250) |
| Outer pytest timeout | 1080s (per-test wall-clock cap, ~180s fixture-teardown slack, F-250) |
| Job ID | `init-sh-suite` |
| Job name | `pytest init.sh suite — ${{ matrix.os }}` |

**Test files covered** (F-248 substitution suite + F-250 unit modules + F-256 source-pattern-hardening suite, all wired into the same pytest invocation per the path-filter completeness pattern):

F-248 substitution suite (per ADR-038 §Test Coverage — 8 substitution + 4 rejection + 1 case-13 + 1 residual + 1 constitution + 3 self-delete + 2 fixture-replay = 20 tests):

- `tests/scripts/test_init_sh_substitution.py`
- `tests/scripts/test_init_sh_adversarial.py`
- `tests/scripts/test_init_sh_constitution.py`
- `tests/scripts/test_init_sh_self_delete.py`

F-250 unit modules (sub-second per case — adversarial extraction + canary):

- `tests/scripts/test_template_substitute_unit.py`
- `tests/scripts/test_init_input_unit.py`
- `tests/scripts/test_substitute_shim_canary.py`

F-256 source-pattern-hardening suite (per ADR-040 §Test Coverage — Sites A-D + Stream 4 watchdog + lint guard):

- `tests/scripts/test_init_sh_defaults_env.py` — Site A integration: `scripts/init.sh` against `stacks/*/defaults.env` (positive packs + malicious-pack rejection + missing-key rejection)
- `tests/scripts/test_template_config_load_unit.py` — Canonical `aod_template_load_kv_file` primitive surface (29 parametrized cases — comments, blanks, trailing newline, NUL-byte rejection, key-case enforcement, allowlist enforcement, indirect array access)
- `tests/scripts/test_template_config_load_integration.py` — Full-library round-trip: writer-reader semantic equivalence with the deprecated `source` pattern across personalization-env + aod-kit-version + defaults.env fixtures
- `tests/scripts/test_template_git_clone_timeout.py` — Stream 4 watchdog + `AOD_FETCH_TIMEOUT` adopter env-var contract (hanging-upstream timeout, validation-rejection footguns, fast-clone happy-path + zombie-watchdog assertion)
- `tests/scripts/test_template_substitute_lint_no_eval.py` — Lint guard: asserts post-F-256 `template-substitute.sh` contains zero `eval` invocations (closes TACHI-VULN-9a7512071b4a regression-resistance)

F-282 / F-5 pre-commit-secret-scanning matrix (added 2026-05-10):

- `tests/scripts/test_init_precommit_matrix.py` — Validates the F-5 init.sh prompt block: `--no-precommit` skip path, `--precommit` force-install path, default-Y TTY path, non-TTY silent-skip path, `pre-commit --version >= 3.5.0` floor check (warn-and-continue when below), pre-commit-not-installed path (warn-and-continue, no abort). Both `macos-latest` (bash 3.2.57) and `ubuntu-latest` (bash 5.x) legs MUST pass.

**Path filter (NFR-005 — scope discipline)**: The workflow ONLY fires when files in the combined F-248 substitution surface + F-256 source-pattern surface change. Pure docs edits, ADR text, or unrelated agent-tier changes do NOT trigger this job. Mirrors the narrow-scope pattern of `tachi-mmdc-preflight.yml` and avoids burning CI minutes on edits that cannot affect substitution or config-loading behaviour. The complete trigger set is:

```yaml

```

**Path-filter completeness pattern (F-250 lesson, reinforced by F-256, applied verbatim by F-282/F-5)**: The `paths:` filter and the `pytest` invocation MUST be kept in lock-step. F-250 hot-fixed an asymmetry where 3 unit modules were added to the test invocation but omitted from `paths:`, so edits scoped to those modules silently bypassed CI. F-256 added 5 new test modules + 1 new bash library file (`template-config-load.sh`) + a new fixture tree (`tests/fixtures/config-load/`) — all wired through both the trigger list and the pytest invocation in a single commit. F-282 / F-5 added one new test module (`tests/scripts/test_init_precommit_matrix.py`) — wired through both the trigger list AND the pytest invocation in a single commit (T020 in the F-5 task plan, ratified at /aod.deliver close-out). When adding a new test file or library file in future work, update BOTH the `paths:` trigger list AND the `python -m pytest ...` command in the same commit — and verify the file appears in both.

Edits to other shell scripts, agent files, ADRs, or documentation will not invoke this workflow even if the PR also includes substitution-surface changes — GitHub Actions evaluates the path filter at the PR level, so the workflow fires when at least one matching path is in the diff.

**pyyaml dependency**: `tests/scripts/conftest.py` imports `yaml` at module scope. The dependency is cross-suite — shared with the BLP-01 + F-241 detection-agent attestation tests that load `schemas/finding.yaml` and `.claude/agents/tachi/*.yml` schemas. Bumping `pyyaml` in this workflow MUST be coordinated with those suites.

**Baseline fixture**: `tests/fixtures/init-baseline-tree/` contains the canonical post-init filesystem snapshot that `test_init_sh_substitution.py` and `test_init_sh_adversarial.py` diff against. The accompanying `tests/fixtures/regenerate-baseline.sh` script is the **only** supported way to regenerate the baseline — it pins the deterministic substitution inputs (`AOD_RATIFICATION_DATE_OVERRIDE`, `AOD_CURRENT_DATE_OVERRIDE`) and drives `scripts/init.sh` against a clean clone. Run it whenever the canonical placeholder set expands (e.g., new `{{...}}` token added) or upstream template content additions land. See `docs/devops/environment-variables.md` for the full env-var contract.

**Performance characteristics (macOS leg)**: macOS runners are notoriously ~3-4× slower than dev hardware for arm64 bash work — a single `scripts/init.sh` invocation that takes ~140-175s on a developer workstation can take ~560-700s cold-cache on `macos-latest` at the 4× worst-case multiplier. F-248 originally tuned a 300s/360s inner/outer pair that worked on the Ubuntu leg but flaked the macOS leg during close-out. F-250 (PR #253, 2026-05-04) re-tuned the timeout budget and restructured the fixture topology to fit the observed cold-cache budget without masking real regressions.

**F-250 timeout philosophy (current)**: The timeout pair is sized to the slowest reasonable cold-cache scenario plus deliberate slack, NOT the fastest happy-path scenario.

| Layer | Value | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Inner subprocess (`run_init_in_clone(timeout_sec=)` default) | 900s | Caps a single `scripts/init.sh` invocation. Headroom over the 560-700s observed worst case so that the timeout fires only on a genuine hang, not on cold-cache compounding. |
| Outer pytest (`--timeout=1080`) | 1080s | Per-test wall-clock cap = inner cap + ~180s fixture-teardown slack. Aligns with the inner cap so a subprocess timeout surfaces as the inner exception (preserving diagnostic stderr) before the outer cap fires. |

The 1080s outer cap is intentional: it MUST be > the inner 900s cap to ensure the helper's `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` raises with stderr captured rather than being preempted by a pytest-level timeout that drops the subprocess output.

**F-250 fixture restructure**: F-248 originally declared the `init_run` fixture at module scope across 5 separate test modules — every module paid the cold-cache cost on first use, summing to 5×300s+ on the macOS leg. F-250 promoted `init_run` to a session-scoped fixture in `tests/scripts/conftest.py` so the macOS cold-cache cost is paid ONCE per pytest session instead of once per module. Combined with the new timeout budget, observed wall time on the macOS leg dropped from the 30-40 minute band into a 5-7 minute band on the post-merge CI run.

**KPIs observed on PR #253 (F-250 merge run, 2026-05-04)**:

| Runner | Wall time | Status | Baseline (pre-F-250) |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------------------|
| `ubuntu-latest` | 1m29s | green | unchanged |
| `macos-latest` | 5m19s | green | 30-40 min flaky band |

Both legs green on first attempt; release-please PR #254 auto-opened ~35s post-merge. The macos-latest run is now well under the 15-minute target informally adopted as the upper bound for CI-test feedback loop tolerance.

**F-248 closeout addendum (now superseded by F-250)**: F-248 PR #249 merged via admin-override squash-merge with the macOS leg flaking on the 300s timeout. F-250 — landed same day — converts that scoped exception back into a deterministic green by re-budgeting the timeouts and restructuring the fixture topology. The substitution surface itself was never the regression; the CI-runner cost was.

**Diagnostic step** — every run prints `bash --version` for both `/bin/bash` and the default `bash` so the macOS 3.2 vs. Ubuntu 5.x split is visible in CI logs without parsing the matrix metadata.

**Local invocation** (matches CI exactly post-F-250):

```bash
# Install dependencies (matches CI versions)
python -m pip install 'pytest>=8' 'pytest-timeout>=2' 'pyyaml>=6'

# Run the full F-248 + F-256 + F-282 hardening suite (matches CI exactly)
python -m pytest \
  tests/scripts/test_init_sh_substitution.py \
  tests/scripts/test_init_sh_adversarial.py \
  tests/scripts/test_init_sh_constitution.py \
  tests/scripts/test_init_sh_self_delete.py \
  tests/scripts/test_template_substitute_unit.py \
  tests/scripts/test_init_input_unit.py \
  tests/scripts/test_substitute_shim_canary.py \
  tests/scripts/test_init_sh_defaults_env.py \
  tests/scripts/test_template_config_load_unit.py \
  tests/scripts/test_template_config_load_integration.py \
  tests/scripts/test_template_git_clone_timeout.py \
  tests/scripts/test_template_substitute_lint_no_eval.py \
  tests/scripts/test_init_precommit_matrix.py \
  -v --timeout=1080
```

On dev hardware the suite finishes in ~3-4 minutes (vs. the 5-7 minute cold-cache band on `macos-latest`). The 1080s `--timeout` is sized for the worst-case CI runner, not for local; on a fast workstation, no test approaches the cap.

**Full contract**: `specs/248-substitution-surface-hardening/spec.md` (FR-001..FR-011, NFR-001 bash floor, NFR-005 scope discipline). F-250 hot-fix: `specs/250-adversarial-unit-extraction-hotfix/spec.md`. F-256 source-pattern hardening: `specs/256-source-pattern-hardening/spec.md` (FR-1..FR-9, NFR-1..NFR-6, SC-1..SC-15). ADRs: `docs/architecture/02_ADRs/ADR-038-placeholder-substitution-strategy.md` (F-248) + `docs/architecture/02_ADRs/ADR-040-config-file-parsing-hardening.md` (F-256). Tasks T039 (workflow authoring) + T040 (CI matrix verification) + T041 (close-out attestation) for F-248; F-250 tasks T001-T029 for the hot-fix; F-256 covers Sites A-D + Stream 4 (T014-T041) + Stream 5 lint (T046).

### F-256 Adopter-Facing Environment Variable

F-256 introduces one adopter-facing environment variable, `AOD_FETCH_TIMEOUT`, read by `.aod/scripts/bash/template-git.sh:98` to bound `git clone` wall-clock cost during `/aod.update` / `make update`. Default 60 seconds; positive-integer validation against `^[1-9][0-9]*$` (rejects `0`, leading-zero forms, non-numeric values); exit `9` on timeout (with partial-checkout cleanup), exit `1` on invalid value. Full contract — including the watchdog process-leak invariant and the Q-3 footgun-rejection ruling — is documented in `docs/devops/environment-variables.md` → "F-256 Source-Pattern-Hardening Adopter Variable".

### Gitleaks CI Parity Workflow (F-282 / F-5)

**Added in Feature 282 / F-5** (Pre-commit Secret-Scanning Defaults), merged via PR #283 (squash commit `18378bd`) on 2026-05-10 — the 5th and final feature of BLP-02 enterprise hardening (5/5 closed).

`.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml` runs a full-repo gitleaks scan on every `pull_request` against `main` as a back-stop for the local pre-commit hook. The CI workflow exists to catch the case where a developer deliberately bypassed the local hook with `git commit --no-verify` (or has not opted into the hook because they are an existing pre-F-5 adopter). Findings are uploaded to GitHub Code Scanning via SARIF so PR reviewers see them inline in the GitHub Security tab.

| Workflow file | `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml` |
| Trigger | `pull_request` against `main` (no path filter — every PR scans the full repo) |
| Runner | `ubuntu-latest` |
| Permissions | `contents: read` + `security-events: write` (required by `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3`) |
| Gitleaks version | **v8.30.1** (pinned) |
| SHA256 checksum | `551f6fc83ea457d62a0d98237cbad105af8d557003051f41f3e7ca7b3f2470eb` (verified before tarball extraction) |
| Scan scope | Full-repo (`gitleaks git`) — NOT PR-diff |
| SARIF category | `gitleaks` (visible under GitHub Security tab → Code Scanning → Tool: gitleaks) |
| `actions/checkout` | `@v4` with `fetch-depth: 0` (full git history needed for `gitleaks git`) |
| SARIF upload action | `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3` |
| `continue-on-error` | `true` on the scan step (so the SARIF upload always runs even when findings are present) |
| `if: always()` | Set on the upload step to guarantee the SARIF artifact is published |

**Native gitleaks invocation, NOT `gitleaks-action@v2` (per ADR-042 §Alternatives)**: the proprietary `gitleaks-action@v2` requires a paid `GITLEAKS_LICENSE` secret for org repos. The license requirement is enforced at runtime — the action fails closed with no warning during dry-run testing. F-5 deliberately downloads the gitleaks binary from the upstream GitHub release tarball, verifies the SHA256 checksum from the upstream `gitleaks_8.30.1_checksums.txt` artifact before extraction, and invokes the binary directly. This avoids the org-wide license trap and preserves SARIF compatibility verbatim.

**Full-repo, not PR-diff (Q5 ruling)**: PR-diff scanning would miss pre-existing un-scanned credentials in older commits of the branch or its history. Full-repo catches them at merge time even if they predate the introduction of the hook. Trade-off: marginally higher CI cost (≈30s on a tachi-sized tree) vs. cleaner credential hygiene over the lifetime of the repo. The SARIF report retains all findings — reviewers triage based on whether the finding is on the PR-diff (immediate concern) or pre-existing (sweep work item).

**Scan invocation** (verbatim from the workflow):

```bash
./gitleaks git \
  --config=.gitleaks.toml \
  --report-format=sarif \
  --report-path=gitleaks.sarif \
  --no-banner \
  --verbose
```

**Deliberate decoupling from the local wrapper**: the CI workflow does NOT invoke `.aod/scripts/bash/precommit-wrap.sh` even though the wrapper is the entry point for local commits. The wrapper writes to stderr (the four-item structured contract: rule ID + file:line + bypass guidance + docs link), which is not SARIF-compatible. Reviewers in CI consume findings via the SARIF report uploaded to Code Scanning; developers at the local hook consume findings via the wrapper's stderr output. The two channels are intentionally separated per spec PM-5 / ADR-042 §Decision.

**Bumping gitleaks**: each minor release of gitleaks requires (a) re-testing against `tests/fixtures/gitleaks-rule-interaction/` to confirm the upstream default ruleset still flags + allow-lists tachi's representative samples, (b) updating the `GITLEAKS_VERSION` and `GITLEAKS_SHA256` constants in `gitleaks.yml` from the upstream `gitleaks_<VERSION>_checksums.txt` artifact, and (c) regenerating the rationale catalog in `docs/standards/PRECOMMIT_HOOKS.md` §3 if any new default rule fires on tachi content. Per ADR-042 §Consequences.

**Local equivalent** (matches CI scan behaviour byte-for-byte minus the SARIF upload):

```bash
# Install gitleaks v8.30.1 locally (macOS):
brew install gitleaks   # or download the v8.30.1 release tarball + verify SHA256 manually

# Run the same scan CI runs:
gitleaks git \
  --config=.gitleaks.toml \
  --report-format=sarif \
  --report-path=gitleaks.sarif \
  --no-banner \
  --verbose

# Inspect findings:
jq '.runs[0].results[] | {rule: .ruleId, file: .locations[0].physicalLocation.artifactLocation.uri, line: .locations[0].physicalLocation.region.startLine}' gitleaks.sarif
```

The local pre-commit hook (`.pre-commit-config.yaml` + `.aod/scripts/bash/precommit-wrap.sh`) runs a different invocation (`gitleaks git --pre-commit --redact --staged`) that scopes to staged content only and emits the wrapper's stderr contract instead of SARIF. Both invocations resolve against the same `.gitleaks.toml` ruleset.

**Full contract**: `specs/282-pre-commit-secret-scanning-defaults/spec.md` (FR-001..FR-013, AC-1..AC-12, NFR-1..NFR-5, R-1..R-5). ADR: `docs/architecture/02_ADRs/ADR-042-pre-commit-secret-scanning-default.md` (§Decision, §Alternatives, §Consequences). Policy log: `docs/standards/PRECOMMIT_HOOKS.md` (per-rule rationale catalog, bypass mechanisms, install paths).

### Tachi Mermaid Preflight Workflow (F145)

**Added in Feature 145** (Maestro Canonical Worked Example, ADR-022 hard-prerequisite of `mmdc`).

`.github/workflows/tachi-mmdc-preflight.yml` runs on `ubuntu-latest` (which does NOT have `mmdc` preinstalled) and asserts the loud-failure path when the Mermaid CLI is absent. Guards ADR-022's "no silent fallback" invariant — if `mmdc` is missing, the threat-modelling pipeline MUST fail explicitly rather than silently degrading to text-only output.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Workflow file | `.github/workflows/tachi-mmdc-preflight.yml` |
| Runner | `ubuntu-latest` (no preinstalled `mmdc`) |
| Trigger | `pull_request` against `main` (path-filtered) |
| Permissions | `contents: read` |
| Validates | Loud-failure exit code + stderr message when `mmdc` is missing |

The workflow is intentionally minimal — it does NOT install `mmdc`; the absence is the point. A separate workflow that exercises the success path (`mmdc` present + diagram rendering) is the responsibility of any feature that uses `mmdc` in CI; F145's preflight only asserts the failure mode is observable.

**Full contract**: `docs/architecture/02_ADRs/ADR-022-mmdc-hard-prerequisite.md`.

### Why bash:3.2 in Docker

All three workflows run inside `bash:3.2` so CI enforces the same shell constraints that bind adopter workstations on macOS (GPLv3 licensing means Apple ships `/bin/bash` 3.2.57). GitHub's `ubuntu-latest` ships bash 5.x — without Docker isolation, bash 4+ regressions (associative arrays, `readarray`, case-modification parameter expansion, etc.) would pass CI and break macOS adopters. See `docs/INSTITUTIONAL_KNOWLEDGE.md` KB Entry 6 for background.

### bash:3.2 Docker Pattern (Reusable)

The `bash:3.2` image is Alpine-based and **does not ship with git**. Validators that shell out to `git ls-files` (both `check-manifest-coverage.sh` and `check-extract-coverage.sh`) need git installed at runtime; `stack-contract-lint.sh --all` also benefits from the same bootstrap because repo-wide mode expects the same mounted git worktree. Additionally, the mounted working tree triggers git's dubious-ownership check because the container runs as root while the host runner owns the files. All three workflows use this identical three-line pattern — **mirror it exactly when adding a new bash:3.2 CI step**:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD:/w" \
  -w /w \
  bash:3.2 \
  sh -c "apk add --no-cache git >/dev/null && git config --global --add safe.directory /w && scripts/<validator>.sh"
```

Three concerns addressed:

1. **`apk add --no-cache git`** — installs git inside the Alpine container (the `bash:3.2` image only ships bash + coreutils). `--no-cache` keeps the layer small; git version is whatever Alpine ships at run time — workflows do not depend on a specific version.
2. **`git config --global --add safe.directory /w`** — suppresses git's `dubious ownership in repository` error when the container runs as root against files owned by the runner user. The UID mismatch is expected and safe in CI.
3. **`sh -c "..."`** — the `bash:3.2` image's default entrypoint is bash, but for the `&&`-chained setup we use `sh -c` to keep the command string compact.

`manifest-coverage.yml`, `extract-coverage.yml`, and `stack-contract.yml` all use this exact pattern (the two-step fix — add git + configure safe.directory — was applied to the coverage workflows during F128 delivery after the Alpine image surfaced the issue on first run, and `stack-contract.yml` was authored against the same pattern in F130). New template-maintenance workflows SHOULD copy this pattern verbatim to guarantee CI parity.

### Action Pinning Convention

All third-party GitHub Actions are pinned by full commit SHA, never by floating tag. All three workflows share the same pinned SHA so maintainers can upgrade them at once:

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683  # v4.2.2
```

When upgrading, bump the SHA in `manifest-coverage.yml`, `extract-coverage.yml`, AND `stack-contract.yml` together along with the maintainer-friendly comment. This mirrors the same retag-defense philosophy the update script enforces against upstream template releases.

**Fetch-depth invariant**: Each of the three workflows relies on the full working tree being mounted into the bash:3.2 container. `actions/checkout` defaults to `fetch-depth: 1` which is sufficient for the current validators (they shell out to `git ls-files` against the checked-out worktree, not against history). If a future maintenance workflow needs history (e.g., `git log`, `git merge-base`), set `fetch-depth: 0` on its checkout step — do not regress the existing three by changing the default underneath them.

### Running Validators Locally

Before pushing, run any validator directly. A `make` target is available for extract-coverage:

```bash
# Manifest coverage (F129)
scripts/check-manifest-coverage.sh

# Extract coverage (F128 — validate)
make extract-check
# or: scripts/check-extract-coverage.sh

# Extract coverage (F128 — regenerate snapshot after legitimate manifest change)
make extract-classify
# Writes: scripts/extract-classification.txt
# After running, review the diff (`git diff scripts/extract-classification.txt`)
# as the maintainer acknowledgement step, then commit.

# Stack contract (F130 — repo-wide, matches CI exactly)
bash .aod/scripts/bash/stack-contract-lint.sh --all

# Stack contract (F130 — single pack, fastest while iterating on one STACK.md)
bash .aod/scripts/bash/stack-contract-lint.sh stacks/<pack>/STACK.md
```

Exit code `0` means you're clean. A non-zero exit prints divergences in the compiler-diagnostic format listed above.

### Optional Pre-Commit Hook

Strongly recommended for maintainers. All three checks are fast enough for the pre-commit path. Install with:

```bash
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit <<'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
scripts/check-manifest-coverage.sh
make extract-check
bash .aod/scripts/bash/stack-contract-lint.sh --all
EOF
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## BATS Test Harness Setup (Feature 129+)

**Added in Feature 129.** The bash test suite for shell-scripted features uses [BATS](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) (Bash Automated Testing System). Tests live in `tests/unit/*.bats` and `tests/integration/*.bats`.

### Install

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| macOS (Homebrew) | `brew install bats-core` |
| Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) | `sudo apt-get install bats` |
| Any (no-root / CI fallback) | `git submodule add https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core.git tests/vendor/bats-core` then invoke via `tests/vendor/bats-core/bin/bats` |

Verify with `bats --version` (expected: 1.x or newer).

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the authoritative install guide and the full `bash 3.2` compatibility rules.

### CI Integration (current status)

BATS is **not yet wired into** `manifest-coverage.yml`, `extract-coverage.yml`, or `stack-contract.yml` — those workflows' sole jobs are their respective invariant checks. BATS tests are run locally during development and before PRs. A future CI workflow can opt in by adding a `bats tests/unit/ tests/integration/` step; the `bash:3.2` image already contains `bats` via `apk add bats` (Alpine base).

## Playwright E2E in Adopter CI (FastAPI Stack Packs)

**Added in Feature 138** (2026-04-21). No new CI workflows were added to this template repo — the existing `stack-contract.yml` (F130) validates the `e2e_command` declaration is present and well-formed. Adopters who scaffold `fastapi-react` or `fastapi-react-local` receive an opt-in `test:e2e` npm script they can wire into their own CI.

Reference CI snippet (GitHub Actions; adapt to your provider):

```yaml
- name: Install backend deps
  run: cd backend && uv sync

- name: Install frontend deps
  run: cd frontend && npm ci

- name: Install Playwright browsers
  run: cd frontend && npx playwright install chromium --with-deps

- name: Run E2E tests
  env:
    TEST_DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.TEST_DATABASE_URL }}  # fastapi-react (Postgres) only
    CI: true
  run: npm --prefix frontend run test:e2e

- name: Upload traces on failure
  if: failure()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: playwright-traces
    path: frontend/test-results/
    retention-days: 14
```

`CI=true` disables `reuseExistingServer`. Trace artifacts redact `Authorization` / `Cookie` headers by default but keep retention short on public repos. Full adopter walkthrough: `specs/138-playwright-e2e-fastapi-stack-packs/quickstart.md`.

## `/aod.deliver` Exit-Code Contract (Feature 139)

**Added in Feature 139** (PR #149, merged 2026-04-23). CI pipelines that shell out to `/aod.deliver` — most commonly inside `/aod.run --autonomous` or a post-merge automation job — MUST branch on the full exit-code taxonomy. The three new codes (10, 11, 12) are **additive** to the existing PRD 130 taxonomy (0-5) and are stable forever.

| Exit | Symbol | Source | CI Action |
|------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 0 | `success` | Delivery clean: tests pass, AC coverage complete, docs updated, lock released | Proceed to next pipeline stage. |
| 1 | `runtime_error` | PRD 130 — unexpected runtime failure | Fail the job. Surface stderr. |
| 2 | `missing_test_command` | PRD 130 — stack pack has no declared `test_command` | Fail the job. Operator fixes `STACK.md`. |
| 3 | `xor_violation` | PRD 130 — `test_command` + `e2e_opt_out` both set | Fail the job. Operator resolves. |
| 4 | `unknown_key` | PRD 130 — contract block has an unrecognized key | Fail the job. Operator resolves. |
| 5 | `missing_block` | PRD 130 — no `<!-- BEGIN: aod-test-contract -->` sentinels | Fail the job. Operator resolves. |
| **10** | **`halt-for-review`** | **F139 — verification gate tripped; heal-PR opened/updated** | **NOT a failure. Notify reviewer. Pipeline continues.** Halt record at `.aod/state/deliver-{NNN}.halt.json`. |
| **11** | **`lock-conflict`** | **F139 — another `/aod.deliver {NNN}` holds `.aod/locks/deliver-{NNN}.lock`** | **Retry with bounded backoff.** Conflicting invocation is expected to release the lock on its own exit. |
| **12** | **`abandoned-sentinel`** | **F139 — crash-recovery detected orphaned `.aod/state/deliver-{NNN}.state.json`** | **Operator intervention required.** Do NOT auto-clear from CI — this is a safety rail against concurrent-run corruption. Page on-call if autonomous. |

### Three-Channel Halt Signal (Exit 10)

Exit code 10 is emitted alongside two other signals, **all co-equal by design**:

1. **Stdout line**: `DELIVERY_HALTED: {NNN}` — consumers that tail stdout (humans, log scrapers) see the signal immediately.
2. **Halt-record JSON**: `.aod/state/deliver-{NNN}.halt.json` — consumers that persist state across runs (orchestrators, dashboards) reconstruct halt context.
3. **Exit code 10**: CI shells branch on this.

Do NOT suppress any channel — different consumers read different channels, and muting one breaks the consumer that relies on it. Full rationale: `docs/guides/DELIVERY_HARD_GATE_MIGRATION.md` Q&A.

### Reference CI Snippet

```bash
/aod.deliver "$FEATURE" --autonomous
rc=$?
case $rc in
  0)       echo "::notice::Delivered cleanly"; continue_pipeline ;;
  10)      echo "::notice::Halted for review — heal-PR opened"; notify_reviewer; exit 0 ;;
  11)      echo "::warning::Lock contention — retrying"; retry_with_backoff ;;
  12)      echo "::error::Abandoned sentinel — operator intervention required"; page_on_call; exit 1 ;;
  1|2|3|4|5) echo "::error::Contract failure rc=$rc"; exit "$rc" ;;
  *)       echo "::error::Unknown exit code $rc"; exit "$rc" ;;
esac
```

### Flag Deprecation — `--require-tests`

`/aod.deliver --require-tests` is a **silent no-op** with a stderr deprecation notice for 2 release cycles (grace window ends at release N+2 relative to F139). The flag's original intent — "require tests before closing the feature" — is now the default hard-gate behaviour, so the flag is redundant. Remove it from any CI invocation at your convenience; after release N+2 it will fail argument parsing with exit code 2.

Adopter migration walkthrough: `docs/guides/DELIVERY_HARD_GATE_MIGRATION.md`. AC-coverage migration (legacy prose specs): `docs/guides/AC_COVERAGE_MIGRATION.md`. No new CI workflows are added for this feature — the gate is internal to the `/aod.deliver` skill.

## Update-Script Environment Variables

**Added in Feature 129.** `scripts/update.sh` (invoked by `make update` / `/aod.update`) respects the following environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `CI` | unset | When set (e.g., by GitHub Actions), update.sh defaults to `--dry-run` mode. Explicit `--apply` required to write. Safety guard to prevent accidental writes in automation. |
| `AOD_UPDATE_TMP_DIR` | `.aod/update-tmp` under adopter root | Staging directory override. Must be on the same filesystem as the project root (atomicity via `rename(2)` within the same mount). |
| `FORCE_RETAG` | unset | Override the retag-detection tripwire. Proceeds even if an upstream tag's SHA changed since the last pin. Logs a WARN. Paired with `--force-retag` CLI flag. |
| `AOD_COVERAGE_FILES` | (derived from `git ls-files`) | Test-harness override for `scripts/check-manifest-coverage.sh`. Newline-separated file list. **NOT public contract — for BATS tests only.** |
| `AOD_COVERAGE_MANIFEST` | `<repo_root>/.aod/template-manifest.txt` | Test-harness override. **NOT public contract.** |
| `AOD_COVERAGE_REPO_ROOT` | `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` | Test-harness override. **NOT public contract.** |

**Added in Feature 134.** `scripts/update.sh --bootstrap` (invoked by `make update-bootstrap`) and `scripts/update.sh --check-placeholders` (invoked by `make update --check-placeholders`) respect the following environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `YES` | unset | When set to `1` (via `make update-bootstrap YES=1`), the bootstrap subcommand engages `--yes` mode (non-interactive). Pass-through into the underlying `scripts/update.sh --bootstrap --yes` invocation. |
| `AOD_BOOTSTRAP_TECH_STACK_DATABASE` | unset | **Required in `--yes` mode.** Always-prompt architecture value. Examples: `Postgres`, `MySQL`, `SQLite`. |
| `AOD_BOOTSTRAP_TECH_STACK_VECTOR` | unset | **Required in `--yes` mode.** Always-prompt architecture value. Examples: `pgvector`, `Pinecone`, `Weaviate`, `none`. |
| `AOD_BOOTSTRAP_TECH_STACK_AUTH` | unset | **Required in `--yes` mode.** Always-prompt architecture value. Examples: `JWT`, `Auth0`, `Clerk`, `Supabase Auth`. |
| `AOD_BOOTSTRAP_CLOUD_PROVIDER` | unset | **Required in `--yes` mode.** Always-prompt architecture value. Examples: `Vercel`, `Railway`, `AWS`, `GCP`. |
| `AOD_BOOTSTRAP_<FIELD>` | unset | **Required in `--yes` mode for any auto-discovered field that fell back to low-confidence detection.** Pattern `AOD_BOOTSTRAP_<UPPERCASE_FIELD_NAME>=<value>` for each of the 8 auto-discovered canonical placeholders (e.g., `AOD_BOOTSTRAP_PROJECT_NAME`, `AOD_BOOTSTRAP_PROJECT_URL`). Per-field override only — no global accept-all escape hatch. |
| `AOD_UPSTREAM_URL` | unset | Fallback upstream URL when `CANONICAL_URL=...` is not findable in `scripts/sync-upstream.sh`. In `--yes` mode with no `CANONICAL_URL` discoverable, this env var is required and the command refuses to proceed without it. |

**Added in Feature 128.** `scripts/check-extract-coverage.sh` (invoked by `make extract-check` and the Extract Coverage CI workflow) respects the following environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `SKIP_MARKER` | unset | When set to any non-empty value in default (validate) mode, short-circuits to exit 0. The CI workflow does NOT use this directly — it gates via `if:` on the commit marker `[skip extract-check]`. Intended for local pre-commit hooks that need the same emergency-override semantics. |
| `AOD_COVERAGE_FILES` | (derived from `git ls-files`) | Test-harness override (shared convention with check-manifest-coverage). **NOT public contract.** |
| `AOD_COVERAGE_MANIFEST` | `<repo_root>/scripts/extract-classification.txt` | Test-harness override for the extract-classification snapshot path. **NOT public contract.** |
| `AOD_COVERAGE_REPO_ROOT` | `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` | Test-harness override. **NOT public contract.** |
| `AOD_COVERAGE_EXTRACT_SH` | `<repo_root>/scripts/extract.sh` | Test-harness override for the `extract.sh` path under test. **NOT public contract.** |
| `AOD_COVERAGE_EXTRACTIGNORE` | `<repo_root>/.extractignore` | Test-harness override for the `.extractignore` path under test. **NOT public contract.** |

### Lock Contention & Concurrency

The update script holds `.aod/update.lock` while applying changes. Concurrency mechanics:

- **Lock acquisition**: `flock` fast-path on Linux; atomic `set -o noclobber` create on macOS (and all POSIX systems lacking `flock`). Lock contents: `pid`, 16-char hex `nonce`, ISO-8601 `started_at`, `cmdline`.
- **Default timeout**: ~30 s total wait with bounded retries.
- **Exit code 2**: lock contention — another `/aod.update` is running.
- **Stale-lock handling**: if the recorded PID is dead (`kill -0` returns non-zero) AND the lock is older than 1 hour, the update script force-acquires with nonce re-verify. Dead + <1h returns exit code 2 with a hint to investigate.

Full contract and edge-case behaviour: see `docs/guides/DOWNSTREAM_UPDATE.md` — this is the single source of truth. Spec references: `specs/129-downstream-template-update/spec.md` FR-005 (atomicity) and FR-008 (manifest coverage); `specs/129-downstream-template-update/plan.md` concurrency + CI design.

### Feature 132 Regression Guard (2026-04-23)

**Added in Feature 132** (PR #152, merge commit `47d8956`). `tests/integration/132-coverage-violation-output.bats` guards the `scripts/update.sh` exit-5 output contract against future refactors. The bug it prevents: a command substitution under `set -euo pipefail` previously aborted the script before `local cat_rc=$?` could capture the helper's return value, silently skipping the `[aod] ERROR: manifest coverage violation —` collector. The fix is a 3-line `set +e` / `set -e` bracket around the helper call; the test exercises both the rc=5 (uncategorized file) and rc=1 (malformed manifest) paths.

- **Test file**: `tests/integration/132-coverage-violation-output.bats`
- **Test count**: 2 (rc=5 path + rc=1 path)
- **Fixture isolation**: each test builds a self-contained bare upstream git repo under `$BATS_TEST_TMPDIR` — independent of the live `.aod/template-manifest.txt`, survives future 100%-coverage states
- **Local invocation**: `bats tests/integration/132-coverage-violation-output.bats`
- **CI integration**: no new workflow; the existing BATS harness (`bash:3.2` Docker pattern from F128/F129) already covers this test when BATS is wired into CI. The `manifest-coverage.yml` workflow continues to protect the upstream template's own manifest invariant — the new test protects the update script's output contract, a different layer.

Why-this-matters: F129's initial implementation shipped with 514 BATS tests, none of which exercised the rc=5 collector path — the silent-exit regression only surfaced when adopters ran `make update` against an upstream with uncategorized files. This test closes that gap so the next refactor cannot silently remove the adopter-facing diagnostic. PRD: `docs/product/02_PRD/132-fix-update-sh-silent-exit-2026-04-23.md`.

### Feature 134 Bootstrap + Placeholder Migration BATS Suite (2026-04-25)

**Added in Feature 134** (PR #153, merge commit `f09035b`). `tests/integration/134-bootstrap-placeholder-migration.bats` adds 20 BATS test cases exercising the new `--bootstrap` and `--check-placeholders` subcommands, the `--yes` env-var contract, the sharpened-fingerprint PLSK-internal refusal, and the new exit-code 13 path for placeholder drift. The suite is included in the existing BATS test harness (no new CI workflow) — the `bash:3.2` Docker pattern from F128/F129 already covers it.

- **Test file**: `tests/integration/134-bootstrap-placeholder-migration.bats`
- **Test count**: 20 cases (subcommand mutual-exclusivity, refuse-to-overwrite per FR-002-a, sharpened-fingerprint per FR-002-b, `--yes` env-var enforcement per FR-007, drift-scan output format per SC-002, exit-13 placeholder-drift contract)
- **Fixture isolation**: each test builds its own self-contained adopter fixture under `$BATS_TEST_TMPDIR` — independent of the live `.aod/template-manifest.txt`, the live `scripts/sync-upstream.sh`, and the production `.aod/personalization.env` (if any)
- **Local invocation**: `bats tests/integration/134-bootstrap-placeholder-migration.bats`
- **CI integration**: no new workflow; runs alongside the rest of the BATS suite when wired into CI. The new exit code 13 is asserted in the suite's drift-scan tests (SC-002)

**New exit code: 13 — `placeholder-drift`**: emitted by `scripts/update.sh --check-placeholders` when legacy placeholder occurrences are detected outside the canonical 12-member `AOD_CANONICAL_PLACEHOLDERS` set defined in `.aod/scripts/bash/template-substitute.sh`. Findings format: `<file>:<line>: {{<name>}}` per occurrence on stdout, followed by a migration-guide table. The exit code is **additive** to the existing F129 taxonomy (0–5) and F139 taxonomy (10–12) — CI consumers that branch on update-script exit codes should add explicit handling for `13)` if they call `make update --check-placeholders` from automation. Stable forever.

PRD: `docs/product/02_PRD/134-update-bootstrap-placeholder-migration-2026-04-24.md`. Spec: `specs/134-update-bootstrap-placeholder-migration/spec.md`. Adopter walkthrough: `docs/guides/DOWNSTREAM_UPDATE.md`.

## Platform Guides

### GitHub Actions (Recommended)

**Best For**: Projects hosted on GitHub, flexible workflow needs

**Setup**:
1. Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
2. Define workflow stages (lint, test, build, deploy)
3. Add repository secrets (Settings → Secrets and Variables)

**Example Workflow**:
```yaml
name: CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:

### Vercel (Frontend/Full-Stack)

**Best For**: Next.js, React, Vue, static sites

**Setup**:
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link project: `vercel link`
3. Configure via `vercel.json` or dashboard

**Auto-Deploy**:
- **PR**: Auto-deploys to preview URL
- **main branch**: Auto-deploys to production

**Configuration** (`vercel.json`):
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": "{{FRAMEWORK}}",
  "regions": ["{{REGION}}"]
}
```

### Railway (Backend/Full-Stack)

**Best For**: Node.js, Python, Go, Docker-based apps

**Setup**:
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Configure build command
3. Set environment variables
4. Define services in `railway.toml`

**Resources**:
- [Railway Documentation](https://docs.railway.app/)

### GitLab CI

**Best For**: Projects on GitLab

**Setup**: Create `.gitlab-ci.yml`

**Example**:
```yaml
stages:
  - test
  - deploy

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm test

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploy to production"
  only:
    - main
```

## Essential CI/CD Components

### 1. Linting
```yaml
- name: Lint Code
  run: npm run lint
```

### 2. Type Checking
```yaml
- name: Type Check
  run: npm run typecheck
```

### 3. Unit Tests
```yaml
- name: Run Tests
  run: npm test
```

### 4. Build Verification
```yaml
- name: Build Application
  run: npm run build
```

### 5. Security Scanning
```yaml
- name: Security Audit
  run: npm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

---

## Environment Variables in CI/CD

### GitHub Actions
```yaml
env:
  DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
  API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
```

### Vercel
- Set via dashboard: Settings → Environment Variables
- Or CLI: `vercel env add VARIABLE_NAME`

---

## Best Practices

### DO ✅
- Run tests before deployment
- Use separate workflows for staging and production
- Cache dependencies to speed up builds
- Set up failure notifications
- Use environment-specific secrets

### DON'T ❌
- Commit secrets to repository
- Skip tests in CI
- Deploy directly to production without staging
- Ignore failed builds
- Use hardcoded credentials

---

## Monitoring CI/CD

Track these metrics:
- **Build Time**: Target <5 minutes
- **Success Rate**: Target >95%
- **Deployment Frequency**: Measure velocity
- **Mean Time to Recovery**: Track incident response

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on CI but Works Locally
- Check Node.js versions match
- Verify all dependencies in package.json
- Check environment variables are set
- Review CI logs for specific errors

### Slow Builds
- Enable dependency caching
- Parallelize test suites
- Optimize build commands
- Use smaller Docker base images

---

## Next Steps

After setting up CI/CD:
1. ✅ Add status badges to README
2. ✅ Configure branch protection rules
3. ✅ Set up deployment notifications
4. ✅ Document deployment process in README
5. ✅ Train team on CI/CD workflows

---

**Template Instructions**: Choose ONE platform and set up basic CI/CD. Expand with additional checks as project matures.
