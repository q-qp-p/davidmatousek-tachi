# OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) - tachi

**Last Updated**: 2026-03-21
**Owner**: Product Manager (product-manager)
**Status**: Template - Complete after MVP launch

## When to Create This

**Create OKRs AFTER your MVP launches and you have baseline metrics.**

Before MVP:
- You don't have baseline numbers to improve
- Your key metrics may not be measurable yet
- Focus should be on shipping, not measuring

**Pre-MVP Goal**: Launch MVP
**Post-MVP**: Set quarterly OKRs based on real usage data

**First OKRs**: Typically set 4-6 weeks after MVP launch when you have initial metrics.

> **AOD Lifecycle Note**: OKR documents can be scaffolded via `/aod.okrs`, which
> generates a standard OKR template (Objective, Key Results, Initiatives) in this
> directory with PM sign-off. `/aod.define` reads current OKRs for PRD alignment,
> and `DOCS_TO_UPDATE_AFTER_NEW_FEATURE.md` includes OKR progress as a checklist
> item during `/aod.deliver`. You can still create and maintain OKR files manually.

## Overview

OKRs align the team around measurable goals. They answer:
- **Objective**: What do we want to achieve? (qualitative)
- **Key Results**: How do we know we achieved it? (quantitative)

## OKR Best Practices

### Objectives (Qualitative)
- ✅ Inspiring and motivational
- ✅ Aligned with product vision
- ✅ Achievable but ambitious
- ❌ Not a task list

**Example Good Objectives**:
- "Become the go-to platform for [user segment]"
- "Delight users with exceptional [experience]"
- "Establish market leadership in [category]"

### Key Results (Quantitative)
- ✅ Specific and measurable
- ✅ Time-bound (end of quarter)
- ✅ 70-80% achievable (stretch goal)
- ❌ Not activities (use metrics)

**Example Good Key Results**:
- "Increase active users from 1,000 to 5,000"
- "Achieve NPS score of 50+"
- "Reduce churn from 10% to 5%"

## Integration with Product Workflow

### OKRs Drive PRDs
- Each PRD should support at least one key result
- PRD success metrics align with OKR key results
- PRD prioritization based on OKR impact

### OKRs Inform Roadmap
- Roadmap phases deliver on quarterly OKRs
- Feature prioritization based on OKR contribution
- Roadmap adjusts if OKRs change

---

## Review Cadence

### Weekly Check-In (15 min)
- Update key result progress
- Identify blockers
- Adjust tactics if needed

### End of Quarter Review (2 hours)
- Score all key results (0.0 - 1.0 scale)
- Document learnings
- Plan next quarter OKRs

---

**Template Instructions**: Create a new OKR file each quarter (YYYY-QN.md). Delete this message after creating your first OKR document.

---

## Feature Delivery Log

> **Purpose**: Track feature deliveries for OKR alignment once quarterly OKRs are established.
> Features listed here should be mapped to Key Results when OKRs are created.

| Date | Feature | PRD | Impact |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
