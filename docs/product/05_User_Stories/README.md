# User Stories - tachi

**Last Updated**: 2026-04-24 (Feature 206 delivered — F-2 Misinformation Threat Agent / OWASP LLM09:2025)
**Owner**: Product Manager (product-manager)
**Status**: Template - Complete after MVP launch

---

## When to Create This

**Create detailed user stories AFTER your MVP launches.**

Before MVP:
- High-level features in your PRD are sufficient
- Detailed stories emerge from real usage patterns
- You'll waste time on stories for features that change

**Pre-MVP**: Use PRD feature list → build MVP
**Post-MVP**: Break down backlog items into user stories based on actual needs

**Exception**: You can create user stories for complex MVP features that need detailed acceptance criteria.

> **AOD Lifecycle Note**: User stories generated during `/aod.discover` validation
> are stored in **GitHub Issue bodies**, not in this directory. GitHub Issues with
> `stage:*` labels are the source of truth for user stories. This directory serves
> as a reference for story format and prioritization guidance. See
> `docs/product/_backlog/BACKLOG.md` for the auto-generated backlog index.

---

## Overview

User stories describe features from the user's perspective. They follow the format:
> **As a** [persona], **I want** [capability], **so that** [benefit]

---

## User Story Template

```markdown
## US-NNN: [Story Title]

**As a** [persona from target-users.md],
**I want** [capability or action],
**so that** [business value or user benefit].

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [expected result]
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [expected result]

### Related
- **Persona**: [Link to target-users.md]
- **PRD**: [Link to relevant PRD]
- **Priority**: [P0 Critical | P1 High | P2 Medium | P3 Low]

### Notes
[Additional context or constraints]
```

---

## User Story Prioritization

### P0 - Critical (Must Have)
- Blocks core user workflows
- Required for product to function
- Legal or security requirements

### P1 - High (Should Have)
- High user value
- Significant pain point resolution
- Competitive differentiation

### P2 - Medium (Nice to Have)
- Moderate user value
- Quality of life improvements
- Secondary workflows

### P3 - Low (Future)
- Low user value
- Edge cases
- Deferred for later phases

---

## Integration with PRDs

Each PRD should include relevant user stories:
- PRD functional requirements map to user stories
- User story acceptance criteria become PRD requirements
- User stories validated during spec creation

---

**Template Instructions**: Organize user stories by phase or feature area. Delete this message after creating your first user stories.

---

## Aggregated Feature Stories

> **Auto-populated by `/aod.deliver`**: When a feature is delivered, `/aod.deliver` extracts
> validated user stories from the feature's GitHub Issue body and appends them below under
> a `### Feature NNN: {feature-name}` heading. **GitHub Issues remain the source of truth**
> for user stories — this section provides a consolidated reference across delivered features.

- **US-136-5** (P1): Typst Template Canonical Alignment - `templates/tachi/security-report/maestro-findings.typ` fallback dictionary corrected to use canonical layer names (resolving pre-existing three-way divergence where template said "Integration Services" for L6); PDF security report MAESTRO Findings page now displays canonical labels for all seven layer bands
- **US-136-6** (P2): Pipeline Documentation and ADR Updates - Dispatch rules, finding format shared reference, README layer table, and ADR-020 (with Feature 136 revision note) all use canonical layer names; historical PRDs 084 and 091 preserved unchanged per immutability policy
- **US-136-7** (P2): Wave 0 Pre-Edit Discovery Report - Committed `specs/136-maestro-canonical-layer/discovery-report.md` documenting pre-edit grep sweep results with file-by-file match inventory, providing audit trail that every hardcoded layer name reference was found and addressed before editing began
- **US-136-8** (P1): Backward Compatibility Validation Gate - Five non-agentic-app example baselines (web-app, microservices, ascii-web-api, mermaid-agentic-app, free-text-microservice) regenerate byte-deterministically under `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000`; `test_backward_compatibility.py` passes against regenerated baselines with idempotency verified

- **US-130-1** (P0): Fail-Fast Preflight Gate - Shell-level preflight gate in `/tachi.security-report` and Python-level `shutil.which("mmdc")` raise in `extract-report-data.py` fire when attack trees contain Critical/High findings and mmdc is not installed
- **US-130-2** (P0): Mid-Render Failure Aggregation - `_render_single` returns structured `error_record` dicts; `render_mermaid_to_png()` collects failures and raises `RuntimeError` with per-finding failure list instead of silently marking `has_image=False`
- **US-130-3** (P0): Text Fallback Removal - Typst text-fallback branch deleted outright from `attack-path.typ`; silent text fallback is no longer a supported shipping mode
- **US-130-4** (P1): ADR-022 Hard Prerequisite Policy - New ADR establishes fail-loud posture for absent CLI prerequisites, gated on input detection (mmdc required only when attack trees present)

**Delivered**: 2026-04-16 | **PR**: #169 | **Tasks**: 43/43 complete (T027 N/A per FR-008 XOR) | **Stories**: 5/5 passing

- **US-144-1** (P1): Compliance Officer NIST Mapping Decision - A single ADR (ADR-025) whose Decision section names tachi's NIST AI RMF posture unambiguously in the first paragraph and whose Context section contains three labeled mapping surfaces (Functions × pipeline phases, Subcategories × compensating-control categories, GAI risks × STRIDE+AI) with every row annotated as Overlap, Gap, Conflict, or "No equivalent"
- **US-144-2** (P1): Security Engineer Procurement Justification - Exactly one ADR Decision section addresses NIST AI RMF; the tachi-control-analysis SKILL.md "NIST AI RMF Relationship" paragraph contains the same decision-noun phrase as ADR-025's Decision section (verbatim string-equality check, modulo case, per SC-007)
- **US-144-3** (P1): CISO Audit Preparation - A tachi-curated reference file at `.claude/skills/tachi-shared/references/nist-ai-rmf-mapping.md` ships either a complete Option A mapping table covering all 8 tachi compensating-control categories to NIST AI RMF Subcategory equivalents, or a relationship-only stub naming the wired-integration site and linking to a follow-on implementation Issue; links resolve on main via relative path

**Delivered**: 2026-04-16 | **PR**: #172 | **Tasks**: 33/33 complete | **Stories**: 6/6 passing

- **US-142-1** (P0): Agent Collusion as an Explicit Filter - Security engineers can filter threat model output by the "Agent Collusion" pattern; coordinated multi-agent attack findings are tagged distinctly from single-agent exploits via the `agentic_pattern` column in threats.md and `maestro-pattern:agent_collusion` SARIF tags, gated by the multi-agent predicate
- **US-142-2** (P0): Temporal Attack Detection - Threat modelers analyzing long-running agentic systems (persistent memory, fine-tuning loops, learning pipelines) see explicit Temporal Attack findings (sleeper agents, gradual corruption, seasonal exploitation, time-delayed activation) invisible to point-in-time STRIDE analysis, with threat descriptions naming the specific temporal vector class
- **US-142-3** (P1): Emergent Behavior Risks Called Out in Threat Report - CISOs reviewing the PDF security assessment see a dedicated "Agentic Pattern Analysis" section placed after Cross-Layer Attack Chains (Feature 141) and before Findings Detail, with per-pattern subsections containing canonical definition, severity counts, 100-200 word narrative, and impacted finding IDs; zero-finding subsections suppressed
- **US-142-4** (P1): Coverage Mapping Documentation - Adopters evaluating tachi's MAESTRO completeness read the coverage mapping table in `maestro-agentic-patterns-shared.md` with one row per canonical pattern and three constrained Coverage Strength values (Full / Partial / None — Coverage Required), with Partial assessments requiring a Gap justification preventing overclaiming
- **US-142-5** (P1): Pattern-Tagged Output for Downstream Tooling - MAESTRO practitioners integrating tachi output can rely on the `agentic_pattern` field being present on every finding with `none` as default (no null-safety logic needed); SARIF output exposes `maestro-pattern:<name>` tags for non-`none` patterns matching the existing `maestro-layer:` convention
- **US-142-6** (P0): End-to-End Multi-Agent Example - Designated multi-agent example demonstrates all three previously-uncovered patterns (Agent Collusion, Emergent Behavior, Temporal Attack) end-to-end with findings in threats.md, populated Agentic Pattern Analysis section in threat-report.md, and corresponding SARIF tags; 5 non-multi-agent baselines show zero new pattern findings under the multi-agent gate predicate

- **US-145-1** (P0): New Adopter Canonical First-Read - A security engineer evaluating tachi opens `examples/README.md`, sees the canonical MAESTRO example called out as the recommended first read for MAESTRO users, opens the example's `README.md`, and gets an adopter-facing tour covering domain overview, MAESTRO layer coverage table, what to look for in the output, and how to read the accompanying files (threats.md, threat-report.md, PDF, infographics)
- **US-145-2** (P0): Evaluator Cross-Layer Attack Chain Demonstration - A security engineer performing a tools evaluation reads the example's generated `threat-report.md` and sees the Cross-Layer Attack Chains section (Feature 141) render at least one attack chain spanning three or more MAESTRO layers with a causal narrative comparable in shape to the CSA canonical financial-trading kill-chain; `attack-chains.md` confirms chain membership traces architectural data-flow lineage (not keyword coincidence)
- **US-145-3** (P0): Canonical Comparison Surface for Multi-Agent Threat Modeling - A CISO, security team lead, or MAESTRO practitioner reviews the example's `threat-report.md` Agentic Pattern Analysis section (Feature 142) and finds at least three of the six canonical agentic patterns populated with narratives; the README's MAESTRO layer coverage table maps every architecture component to one or more MAESTRO layers in a format directly comparable to the CSA canonical mapping
- **US-145-4** (P1): MAESTRO Regression Fixture for Maintainers - A tachi maintainer adding a new feature touching MAESTRO capability runs the backward-compatibility test suite and sees the canonical example regression-check the full MAESTRO surface (all seven layers populated, cross-layer chains surfaced, agentic patterns populated, infographics generated); PDF baseline regenerates byte-identical under `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000` (per ADR-021)
- **US-145-5** (P1): Purpose-Built Validation Target for Future MAESTRO Work - A developer implementing Phase 2 cross-layer chain logic, Phase 3 agentic pattern synthesis, or any follow-on MAESTRO phase has a regression target that naturally exercises multi-layer chains and multi-pattern findings without architectural contortion; seven-layer coverage, inter-agent data flows, persistent-state components, and emergent-behavior descriptions all pre-verified by the Pre-Execution Architecture Review Checklist
- **US-145-6** (P1): Adopter Compliance Framework Cross-References - An adopter reading the canonical MAESTRO example's README encounters a short compliance-posture section (approximately 100-150 words) summarizing tachi's AIVSS (ADR-024) and NIST AI RMF (ADR-025) posture with links to the authoritative ADRs; `examples/README.md` positions the canonical MAESTRO example as distinct from the existing six examples (baseline STRIDE, input-format fixtures, dual-dispatch demo)

- **US-180-1** (P1): Machine-Readable Taxonomy Records - An adopter integrating tachi output into downstream vulnerability manager / SIEM / compliance tooling loads any of 7 catalog YAMLs under `schemas/taxonomy/` (owasp, mitre-attack, mitre-atlas, nist-ai-rmf, cwe, tachi-control-category, tachi-stride-ai-category) via `yaml.safe_load` in a fresh Python 3.11 environment with only `pyyaml` installed and resolves any taxonomy ID (OWASP / MITRE ATT&CK / ATLAS / NIST AI RMF / CWE) to a stable record containing canonical id, full_id, name, url, and cross-framework references without consulting any other file
- **US-180-2** (P1): Single Authoritative Crosswalk - A tachi maintainer or future downstream-feature author queries `crosswalk.yaml` to find all cross-framework edges for a given taxonomy item (e.g., `source.taxonomy == 'owasp' && source.id == 'LLM05'`) and retrieves edges with closed `edge_type` enum (primary/related/superseded), `confidence` enum (high/medium/low), and per-edge citation — 526 primary edges at merge time (exceeding ≥500 Tier 1 floor), including verbatim transcription of 27 NIST AI RMF Surface B mapping rows per FR-022
- **US-180-3** (P2): Documented Curation Methodology - A reviewer or future maintainer opens `schemas/taxonomy/README.md` alone and finds §Purpose with runnable Python snippet demonstrating the resolution pattern for all 7 catalog YAMLs, 7 per-framework provenance sections, 3-level confidence calibration rubric with anti-drift rule, canonical-URL conventions per framework, 5 per-framework update procedures, and explicit "What F-A1 does NOT give you today" subsection naming deferred downstream-feature capabilities
- **US-180-4** (P1): Referential Integrity Test Suite - A code reviewer or CI system runs `pytest tests/schemas/test_taxonomy_integrity.py` on a freshly-cloned repo and all 5 tests pass green (`test_framework_yamls_load`, `test_crosswalk_loads`, `test_crosswalk_referential_integrity`, `test_citation_shape`, plus optional sort test); integrity suite enforces FR-027 through FR-032 including referential integrity (every edge's source.id and target.id resolve to catalog records), closed-enum membership (7-value taxonomy, 3-value edge_type, 3-value confidence), and citation shape (URL-regex or existing file path)
- **US-180-5** (P2): Public ADR on Merge - A future tachi contributor opens `docs/architecture/02_ADRs/ADR-027-taxonomy-crosswalk-schema.md` at Status: Accepted, reads per-item record shape, per-edge record shape, 7-value taxonomy enum rationale, 3-value edge_type enum rationale, 3-value confidence enum rationale, scope-exception rationale for shipping F-A1 as a single PRD despite aggregating 9 files, and cross-references to ADR-020 / ADR-021 / ADR-023 / ADR-024 / ADR-025; three follow-on Issues filed (F-A1.1 Surface C deferred per architect Option (c), F-A1.2 related/superseded edges, F-A1.3 citation link-rot)

### Feature 189: F-A2 Source Attribution Schema Extension

**PRD**: [189-source-attribution-schema-extension](../02_PRD/189-source-attribution-schema-extension-2026-04-17.md)
**Delivered**: 2026-04-17 | **PR**: #190 | **Tasks**: 36/36 complete | **Stories**: 3/3 passing
**Spec**: [specs/189-source-attribution-schema-extension/spec.md](../../../specs/189-source-attribution-schema-extension/spec.md)

- **US-189-1** (P0): Multi-Framework Citation on a Single Finding - When a threat agent emits a finding that addresses multiple compliance-framework items simultaneously (e.g., LLM05 improper output handling spans OWASP LLM05, CWE-1426, and MITRE ATLAS AML.T0051), cite all three items on the single finding without duplicating finding rows — the finding's semantic unit remains intact while every cited item becomes programmatically aggregable. `schemas/finding.yaml` `schema_version` exactly `"1.5"` (minor bump from 1.4 per ADR-026 additive-field rule); `source_attribution` field optional (field-absent on findings that don't cite anything, NOT defaulted to empty array); multi-record arrays preserve input order
- **US-189-2** (P0): Parser Round-Trip Preserves Backward Compatibility - When the pipeline parses the Section 7 table in `threats.md` on any of the 5 existing non-agentic example baselines, get back the same finding objects as pre-F-A2 — no extra keys, no dropped keys — so F-A2 is truly additive and the SC-2 byte-deterministic regeneration gate passes. `scripts/tachi_parsers.py::parse_threats_findings` omits `source_attribution` key when absent from source (no implicit default array injection — preserves Feature 104 `delta_status`-style conditional-key precedent); 5 non-agentic example PDF baselines (`web-app`, `microservices`, `ascii-web-api`, `mermaid-agentic-app`, `free-text-microservice`) regenerate byte-identically under `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000`
- **US-189-3** (P0): Closed-Enum `relationship` with Referential Integrity - When a coverage auditor reads a finding's `source_attribution` array downstream, knows from the `relationship` value whether the cited item is the primary item the finding addresses, a related item, or a derived item, so F-B coverage attestation can weight primary citations differently from related or derived ones. Two-tier validation architecture: V1/V2/V3/V5 enum validation at parse time (closed 5-value `taxonomy` enum `{owasp, mitre-attack, mitre-atlas, nist-ai-rmf, cwe}` excluding 2 tachi-internal taxonomies, closed 3-value `relationship` enum `{primary, related, derived}` with `primary` default); V4 referential-integrity validation as separate callable phase resolving each `{taxonomy, id}` against `schemas/taxonomy/{taxonomy}.yaml` catalog records from Feature 180

### Feature 194: F-B Coverage Attestation Report Section

**PRD**: [194-coverage-attestation-report-section](../02_PRD/194-coverage-attestation-report-section-2026-04-18.md)
**Delivered**: 2026-04-18 | **PR**: #195 | **Tasks**: 45/46 complete (T044 post-merge SHA fill deliberately pending for direct commit to main after `/aod.deliver`) | **Stories**: 3/3 passing
**Spec**: [specs/194-coverage-attestation-report-section/spec.md](../../../specs/194-coverage-attestation-report-section/spec.md)

- **US-194-1** (P1): Per-Finding Attribution Table - A security reviewer opens the PDF security report and wants to audit which OWASP / MITRE ATT&CK / MITRE ATLAS / NIST AI RMF / CWE items a specific finding cites, seeing a single paginated table with one row per finding and per-taxonomy citation columns (`Finding ID | Title | Severity | OWASP refs | MITRE refs | NIST refs | CWE refs`), with `relationship: primary` citations rendered bold and `related`/`derived` plain (WCAG AA color-blind accessible — bold vs plain weight, not color alone), MITRE column grouping ATT&CK and ATLAS together with per-ref prefix (`ATT&CK:T1070.001` vs `ATLAS:AML.T0051`) — audit completes without opening `threats.md` source or cross-referencing separate taxonomy files
- **US-194-2** (P1): Aggregate Per-Framework Coverage Matrix - An adopter or evaluator wants to answer "what fraction of OWASP LLM Top 10 does this engagement cover, and which items are the gaps?" from the PDF alone, seeing exactly one page per external framework (OWASP, MITRE ATT&CK, MITRE ATLAS, NIST AI RMF, CWE — all 5 rendered, including framework pages where every item is a Gap per 0% coverage valid-answer rule) with every item classified as Covered (≥1 `primary` attribution) / Partial (zero `primary` AND ≥1 `related`/`derived`) / Gap (zero attributions), coverage percentage `K / N` where `N = len(yaml.safe_load(schemas/taxonomy/{framework}.yaml))` (authoritative F-A1 YAML record count computed once at extraction time per ADR-029 Q2-A), Partial count rendered alongside with equal visual weight (`Covered: 12/38 = 31.6% · Partial: 3 · Gap: 23`), Gap items highlighted with color + icon distinction (WCAG AA color-blind accessible); matrix is intra-framework only (zero `crosswalk.yaml` JOIN per FR-017) and excludes 2 internal taxonomies (`tachi-control-category`, `tachi-stride-ai-category`) per FR-018
- **US-194-3** (P1): Conditional Inclusion Preserves Backward Compatibility - A tachi maintainer regenerates the 5 non-agentic example PDFs (`web-app`, `microservices`, `ascii-web-api`, `mermaid-agentic-app`, `free-text-microservice`) and expects byte-identical output under `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000` per ADR-021 because no finding carries `source_attribution` yet (F-A3 populators haven't shipped); `scripts/extract-report-data.py::compute_has_source_attribution` emits `#let has-source-attribution = false` to the Typst data contract, `templates/tachi/security-report/main.typ` §2b defaults block carries a default-value guard preventing "variable not found" compile errors on stale `report-data.typ` files, and the `#if has-source-attribution and per-finding-rows.len() > 0 { ... }` conditional block omits the entire coverage-attestation section (no page break, no section header, no divider, no empty table) when either predicate is false — SC-002 regression gate green, 5/5 baselines byte-identical post-F-B

### Feature 201: F-1 Output Integrity Threat Agent (OWASP LLM05:2025)

**PRD**: [201-output-integrity-threat-agent](../02_PRD/201-output-integrity-threat-agent-2026-04-18.md)
**Delivered**: 2026-04-19 | **PR**: #202 | **Tasks**: 55/55 complete | **Stories**: 3/3 passing
**Spec**: [specs/201-output-integrity-threat-agent/spec.md](../../../specs/201-output-integrity-threat-agent/spec.md)

- **US-201-1** (P1): LLM-Output-to-Downstream-Sink Detection - A security analyst threat-models an architecture where LLM output flows into a browser, SQL query, shell, template engine, file write, or outbound HTTP client without post-model sanitization and expects tachi to flag those components with concrete `OI-{N}` findings citing OWASP LLM05:2025 so the XSS / SQLi / SSRF / template-injection / path-traversal surface (which input-side `prompt-injection` detection does not cover) is surfaced with the same rigor as the input side. Given an architecture containing an LLM Process whose output flows into at least one downstream execution sink, running `/tachi.threat-model` emits ≥1 `OI-{N}` finding with `category: llm`, OWASP LLM05:2025 in `references`, and a populated `source_attribution` array containing `{taxonomy: owasp, id: LLM05, relationship: primary}` plus the applicable CWE related entry; given an architecture with no such flow, the agent emits **zero** findings (two-part emission gate enforced per FR-011: keyword match AND structural indicator of a downstream execution sink both required)
- **US-201-2** (P1): Stack-Specific Mitigation Guidance - A developer reading an `OI-{N}` finding needs to address the issue in a codebase and expects the `mitigation` field to name specific encodings, libraries, or patterns matched to the detected sink type so the fix can be applied without re-deriving the output-handling pattern from primary OWASP / CWE sources. For every emitted `OI-{N}` finding, the `mitigation` field names at least one specific encoding mechanism, library, or defensive pattern matched to the sink type — client-side execution: `textContent` (not `innerHTML`) / React `{value}` (not `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`) / Django `{{ value }}` (not `|safe`) / CSP `script-src 'self' 'nonce-<nonce>'`; server-side execution: SQLAlchemy `text(sql).bindparams()` / psycopg2 parametrized `cursor.execute(sql, params)` / `subprocess.run([cmd, arg1, arg2], shell=False)`; SSRF: URL allowlist + egress firewall blocking `169.254.169.254`; template injection: Jinja2 `SandboxedEnvironment`; path traversal: `pathlib.Path(filename).resolve().is_relative_to(allowlisted_output_dir)` — no generic "sanitize output" prose (T021 Wave 2 specificity check green)
- **US-201-3** (P1): Heuristic A Resolution for ASI09 Scope - An adopter runs tachi on an agentic application where an LLM-bearing agent uses misleading tone, overconfident claims, false authority signaling, or manipulative persuasion against a human downstream consumer and expects ADR-030 to make an explicit Heuristic A determination on whether ASI09 Human-Agent Trust Exploitation is covered by `output-integrity` (Outcome A) or by a future `trust-exploitation` agent shipped as F-4 (Outcome B). ADR-030 Decision 2 resolves **Outcome B (split)** with justification referencing GUIDE-threat-coverage-research §11 Heuristic A signal-class taxonomy: F-1 owns encoding/sanitization signal class (bytes / strings / syntax primitives on machine-victim output handling); F-4 reserved for psychology/linguistics signal class (manipulative tone, fabricated authority, absence of uncertainty disclaimers). F-1's `## Purpose` section explicitly forward-references `trust-exploitation` (F-4) as the future owner and lists ASI09 as out-of-scope; BLP-01 §8 blocking gate for F-4 `/aod.discover` invocation satisfied on F-1 merge

### Feature 206: F-2 Misinformation Threat Agent (OWASP LLM09:2025)

**PRD**: [206-misinformation-threat-agent](../02_PRD/206-misinformation-threat-agent-2026-04-23.md)
**Delivered**: 2026-04-24 | **PR**: #207 | **Tasks**: 62/62 complete | **Stories**: 3/3 passing
**Spec**: [specs/206-misinformation-threat-agent/spec.md](../../../specs/206-misinformation-threat-agent/spec.md)

- **US-206-1** (P1): Ungrounded-Factual-Output Detection - A security analyst threat-models an architecture where an LLM emits factual, citation-bearing, or decision-critical output without a declared grounding, verification, or confidence-calibration mechanism and expects tachi to flag those components with concrete `MI-{N}` findings citing OWASP LLM09:2025 so the misinformation risk surface — which neither input-side `prompt-injection` nor output-side `output-integrity` covers — is surfaced before the output reaches end users, downstream automated decisions, or regulatory-exposed systems. Given an architecture containing an LLM Process whose output exhibits factual-output indicators (factual claims, citations, recommendation/decision outputs, or high-stakes domain signals) without declared grounding, running `/tachi.threat-model` emits ≥1 `MI-{N}` finding with `category: llm`, OWASP LLM09:2025 in `references`, and a populated `source_attribution` array containing `{taxonomy: owasp, id: LLM09, relationship: primary}` plus `{taxonomy: cwe, id: CWE-345, relationship: related}`; given an architecture with no qualifying Process or only purely-stylistic LLM output, the agent emits **zero** findings (two-part emission gate per FR-011: LLM keyword match AND factual-output indicator both required; keyword-only match produces no finding to prevent false positives on stylistic-only LLM Processes)
- **US-206-2** (P1): Named Grounding / Verification Mitigation Guidance - A developer reading an `MI-{N}` finding needs to address it in their application and expects the `mitigation` field to name specific grounding, verification, HITL, or calibration mechanisms matched to the detected pattern category so the fix can be applied without inventing a mitigation pattern from scratch or re-deriving from primary OWASP / NIST / ATLAS sources. For each emitted `MI-{N}` finding, the `mitigation` field names at least one specific grounding, verification, HITL, or calibration mechanism matched to the finding's pattern category — ungrounded factual emission → `mandatory RAG grounding with per-claim source attribution` / `retrieval-strength metric declaration (hit-rate, recall@k)` / `confidence-calibration layer (temperature scaling + ECE monitor)`; citation fabrication → `output-time citation verification against retrieved source URIs` / `strict citation-token constraint on decoder output`; overreliance / missing HITL → `human-in-the-loop review queue on decision-critical output` with consumer-facing-high-stakes (HIGH/CRITICAL) vs internal-low-stakes (MEDIUM or below) distinction; retrieval-grounding gaps → `retrieval-strength metric (hit-rate, recall@k)` / `per-query retrieval-score threshold` / `versioned retrieval corpus with staleness policy`; confidence-calibration absence → `calibration layer (temperature scaling + ECE monitor)` / `refusal pattern for low-confidence queries` / `calibrated-confidence exposure on output`. Every finding's `references` array includes `OWASP LLM09:2025` primary and `source_attribution` carries it at `relationship: primary`; supporting references (`MITRE ATLAS AML.T0042 Verify Attack`, `NIST AI 600-1 §2.4 Hallucination`) appear as prose inside the pattern catalog's Primary Sources list because the referential-integrity validator requires catalog-resolvable IDs and those two entries are absent at PRD time
- **US-206-3** (P1): Factual-Integrity as a First-Class Distinct Threat Class - An adopter runs tachi on an AI-assisted medical, legal, financial, or decision-critical application and expects misinformation to be surfaced as a first-class threat class **distinct from both `prompt-injection` and `output-integrity`** so the adopter-facing report separates "attacker-induced wrong output" (prompt-injection / LLM01), "output crosses unsanitized boundary into execution sink" (output-integrity / LLM05), and "ungrounded wrong output" (misinformation / LLM09). **ADR-031** records the Heuristic A signal-class rationale cross-referencing ADR-030's Decision 1 scope boundary — three scope boundaries explicitly resolved: (a) distinct from `prompt-injection` (input-side attacker-controlled injection — machine-attacker, input primitives), (b) distinct from `output-integrity` (output-sanitization per ADR-030 Decision 1 — machine-victim, bytes/strings/syntax primitives), (c) scoped to factual-integrity (grounding, verification, HITL, calibration — human-victim and decision-cascade-victim, factual-content primitives). The regenerated `agentic-app` example exercising all three surfaces renders `LLM-{N}`, `OI-{N}`, and `MI-{N}` findings adjacent (not synthesized) in the `category: llm` section of `threat-report.md` — each finding's ID prefix preserves its signal-class origin and each finding carries its own `source_attribution` primary (LLM01, LLM05, LLM09 respectively); three-agent simultaneous emission on a single LLM Process is correct behavior, not duplication
