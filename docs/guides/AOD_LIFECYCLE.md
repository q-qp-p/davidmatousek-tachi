## The AOD Lifecycle

The AOD Lifecycle is a single, linear sequence of **6 stages** organized into **3 phases**. All work passes through these stages from idea to delivered, documented feature.

```
         DISCOVERY                    DELIVERY                                     QUALITY
.-----------------------. .----------------------------------------------. .---------------.
|                       | |                                              | |               |
| [1. Discover]-->[2. Define]-->[3. Plan]-->[4. Build]-->[5. Deliver]----->[ 6. Document] |
|                       | |                                              | |               |
'-----------------------' '----------------------------------------------' '---------------'
                                                                |
                                                         Feedback Loop
                                                                |
                                                    New ideas --> Discover
```

Stages 1-5 are orchestrated by `/aod.run`. Stage 6 (Document) is a separate human-driven command (`/aod.document`) for post-delivery quality review.

### Lifecycle with Governance Gates

Governance gates are Triad approval checkpoints that operate **between stages**, not as stages themselves. Gates determine who approves before work advances.

```

## Pre-Lifecycle: Foundation Workshop

Before entering the lifecycle, new projects should run `/aod.foundation` to establish product vision and design identity. This is a one-time setup that populates `product-vision.md` and creates brand files (`brand.md`, `tokens.css`, `anti-patterns.md`) from one of 6 design archetypes.

**Command**: `/aod.foundation` (also supports `--vision` and `--design` flags for partial execution)

---

## Stage Definitions

### 1. Discover (Discovery Phase)

**Purpose**: Capture new feature ideas, score them with ICE, and gather evidence of the problem being solved.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Primary Command** | `/aod.discover` |
| **Key Output** | Scored idea with evidence, GitHub Issue (`stage:discover`) |
| **Governance Gate** | PM validation (tier-dependent) |

### 2. Define (Discovery Phase)

**Purpose**: Create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) through structured Triad review, establishing the "what" and "why" for a feature.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Primary Command** | `/aod.define` |
| **Key Output** | Approved PRD in `docs/product/02_PRD/` |
| **Governance Gate** | Triad PRD review (tier-dependent) |

### 3. Plan (Delivery Phase)

**Purpose**: Produce the specification, architecture plan, and task breakdown. This is the most complex stage, with 3 sequential sub-steps managed by a single router command.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Primary Command** | `/aod.plan` (router -- auto-delegates to sub-steps) |
| **Key Output** | `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md` in `.aod/` |
| **Governance Gates** | PM spec sign-off, PM+Architect plan sign-off, Triple sign-off on tasks |

**Sub-steps** (auto-detected by `/aod.plan`):

| Sub-step | Command | Sign-off |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Specification | `/aod.spec` | PM sign-off |
| Architecture Plan | `/aod.project-plan` | PM + Architect sign-off |
| Task Breakdown | `/aod.tasks` | PM + Architect + Team-Lead sign-off |

### 4. Build (Delivery Phase)

**Purpose**: Execute tasks from the approved task breakdown with architect checkpoints during implementation.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Primary Command** | `/aod.build` |
| **Key Output** | Implemented feature on feature branch |
| **Governance Gate** | Architect checkpoints during execution |

### 5. Deliver (Delivery Phase)

**Purpose**: Close the feature with Definition of Done validation and a structured retrospective that feeds learnings back into discovery.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Primary Command** | `/aod.deliver` |
| **Key Output** | Closed feature, retrospective, KB entry, new ideas (feedback loop) |
| **Governance Gate** | DoD check (all tiers) |

### 6. Document (Quality Phase)

**Purpose**: Human-driven post-delivery quality review. Each step presents findings interactively and commits only what the human approves. This is the one stage designed for human judgment rather than agent automation.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Primary Command** | `/aod.document` |
| **Key Output** | Simplified code, docstrings, CHANGELOG entries, API doc sync, KB review |
| **Governance Gate** | Human approval per step (accept/reject/skip) |

**Steps** (each requires human approval):

| Step | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| Code Simplification | Runs `/simplify` on changed files, presents diff for review |
| Docs-Lint | Flags complex undocumented functions, suggests docstrings |
| CHANGELOG | Generates entries from commits, categorized by conventional commit type |
| API Sync | Compares code endpoints against OpenAPI spec, flags mismatches |
| KB Review | Reviews institutional knowledge entries captured during Build/Deliver |

**Note**: Stage 6 is NOT part of the `/aod.run` orchestrator. It runs separately after Deliver because it requires sustained human interaction and judgment.

---

## Governance Tiers

Governance gates are a **separate, configurable layer** on top of the lifecycle. Choose a tier that matches your project's risk level. The lifecycle stages are the same regardless of tier -- only the gates change.

### Tier Overview

| Tier | Gate Count | When to Use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Light** | 2 | Solo developers, prototypes, internal tools, hackathons |
| **Standard** (default) | 6 | Team projects, production features, most work |
| **Full** | all | Regulated industries, critical systems, high-stakes launches |

### Tier Descriptions

**Light (2 gates)**: Minimal ceremony. Triple sign-off at Plan stage and DoD at Deliver. Discover and Define gates are optional or skipped. For work where speed matters more than risk mitigation.

**Standard (6 gates, default)**: Balanced governance. PM validation at Discover, PRD review at Define, PM+Architect sign-off plus Triple sign-off at Plan, Architect checkpoints at Build, DoD at Deliver. Appropriate for most production work.

**Full (all gates)**: Maximum rigor. Everything in Standard plus a separate PM spec sign-off before the architecture plan. For environments where audit trails and formal approval at every boundary are required.

### Configuration

Set the governance tier in `.aod/memory/constitution.md`:

```yaml
governance:
  tier: standard  # light | standard | full
```

### Rules

- Triple sign-off (PM + Architect + Team-Lead on tasks) is the **minimum governance floor** for all tiers
- DoD check and Architect build checkpoints apply to **all tiers**
- Document stage (human approval per step) applies to **all tiers**
- Tier affects only Discover, Define, and Plan stage gates
- Tier is configured per project, not per feature

---

## Governance Gate Matrix

Which gates activate at each stage, per tier.

| Tier | Discover | Define | Plan | Build | Deliver | Document |
|------|----------|--------|------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Light** | Optional | Skip | Triple sign-off only | Architect checkpoints | DoD | Human approval |
| **Standard** | PM validation | PRD review | PM+Arch + Triple | Architect checkpoints | DoD | Human approval |
| **Full** | PM validation | PRD review | PM spec + PM+Arch plan + Triple | Architect checkpoints | DoD | Human approval |

**Reading the matrix**: "PM+Arch + Triple" means PM and Architect sign-off on the architecture plan, followed by PM + Architect + Team-Lead sign-off on the task breakdown. "PM spec" means a separate PM sign-off on the specification before the architecture plan proceeds.

## Command Reference

### Primary Lifecycle Commands (1 per stage)

| Command | Stage | Phase | What It Does |
|---------|-------|-------|-------------|
| `/aod.discover` | Discover | Discovery | Capture idea, ICE score, evidence prompt, PM validation |
| `/aod.define` | Define | Discovery | Create PRD with Triad review |
| `/aod.plan` | Plan | Delivery | Router: auto-delegates to `/aod.spec`, `/aod.project-plan`, `/aod.tasks` |
| `/aod.build` | Build | Delivery | Execute tasks with architect checkpoints |
| `/aod.deliver` | Deliver | Delivery | Close feature with DoD check and retrospective |
| `/aod.document` | Document | Quality | Human-driven code simplification, docstrings, CHANGELOG, API sync |

### Plan Sub-Commands (invoked by `/aod.plan` router)

| Command | Plan Sub-Step | Output |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| `/aod.spec` | Specification | `spec.md` with PM sign-off |
| `/aod.project-plan` | Architecture Plan | `plan.md` with PM + Architect sign-off |
| `/aod.tasks` | Task Breakdown | `tasks.md` with Triple sign-off |

### Utility Commands (no governance gates)

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/aod.score` | Re-score an existing idea (stays in Discover stage) |
| `/aod.status` | Regenerate BACKLOG.md on demand, show stage summary |
| `/aod.analyze` | Cross-artifact consistency check |
| `/aod.clarify` | Resolve spec ambiguities |
| `/aod.checklist` | Generate quality checklist (Definition of Done) |
| `/aod.constitution` | View or update governance constitution |

### Minimum Feature Sequence

```
/aod.discover --> /aod.define --> /aod.plan --> /aod.build --> /aod.deliver --> /aod.document
```

Six commands. `/aod.plan` auto-advances through 3 sequential sub-steps (spec → project-plan → tasks). Run it up to 3 times — each invocation advances to the next sub-step on approval. `/aod.document` runs separately after delivery for human-driven quality review.
