### Feature 180: F-A1 Taxonomy Crosswalk Collection

## Components

This feature does not add or modify runtime components. The deliverable is a machine-readable reference data directory consumed by no pipeline stage at F-A1 — F-A2 (finding-level source attribution) and F-B (coverage attestation report section) are the planned downstream consumers.

| Component | Type | File Path | Change Type | Rationale |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Taxonomy catalog + crosswalk directory | New reference-data directory | `schemas/taxonomy/` | Create (9 files) | Spec FR-001/FR-002 — machine-readable foundation for downstream cross-framework ID resolution |
| 5 external framework catalog YAMLs | New data files | `schemas/taxonomy/{owasp,mitre-attack,mitre-atlas,nist-ai-rmf,cwe}.yaml` | Create | Spec FR-015/FR-017/FR-020/FR-021 — 5-field `{id, full_id, name, url, cwe_refs}` shape per FR-003; OWASP ≥60, MITRE ATT&CK ≥38, MITRE ATLAS ≥12 (7 seed + 5 curated AML.T0058-T0062), NIST AI RMF = 72 exactly (GOVERN 19 + MAP 18 + MEASURE 22 + MANAGE 13, primary-source-corrected from historical 68), CWE ≥53 (41 seed + 12 net-new from CWE Top 25 2025) |
| 2 tachi pseudo-taxonomy catalog YAMLs | New data files | `schemas/taxonomy/{tachi-control-category,tachi-stride-ai-category}.yaml` | Create | Spec FR-018/FR-019 — 8 canonical control-category slugs (seeded from `.claude/skills/tachi-control-analysis/references/control-categories.md`) + 11 STRIDE+AI category slugs (6 STRIDE + 5 AI, seeded from `.claude/skills/tachi-shared/references/stride-categories-shared.md`) |
| Crosswalk edge file | New data file | `schemas/taxonomy/crosswalk.yaml` | Create (526 primary edges) | Spec FR-009/FR-025 — 5-field edge shape `{source: {taxonomy, id}, target: {taxonomy, id}, edge_type, confidence, citation}`; ≥500 primary-edge floor under R3 Tier 1 default (achieved 526); `related` and `superseded` edges deferred to follow-on Issue |
| Curation methodology README | New documentation | `schemas/taxonomy/README.md` | Create | Spec FR-033 — §Purpose (with runnable Python snippet), §Harvest methodology, §Per-framework provenance (7 sections), §Confidence calibration rubric with anti-drift rule, §Canonical-URL conventions, §Update procedures (5 external frameworks), §Crosswalk methodology, §Single-source-of-truth cross-reference to `nist-ai-rmf-mapping.md`, §"What F-A1 does NOT give you today" subsection naming deferred downstream capabilities (F-A2, F-B, agent-reference migration, Surface C transcription) |
| Referential integrity test suite | New pytest module | `tests/schemas/test_taxonomy_integrity.py` + `tests/schemas/__init__.py` | Create | Spec FR-027 through FR-032 — 4+1 test functions: `test_framework_yamls_load` (FR-028), `test_crosswalk_loads` (FR-029), `test_crosswalk_referential_integrity` (FR-030), `test_citation_shape` (FR-031), optional `test_records_sorted` (FR-032 with numeric-within-function NIST sort clarification) |
| New ADR | New governance record | `docs/architecture/02_ADRs/ADR-027-taxonomy-crosswalk-schema.md` | Create (Proposed→Accepted) | Spec FR-039/FR-040/FR-041 — 8 numbered decisions covering per-item record shape (with unidirectional OWASP→CWE `cwe_refs` rule), per-edge record shape, 7-value `taxonomy` enum, 3-value `edge_type` enum, 3-value `confidence` enum (with anti-drift rule), citation non-empty-and-resolvable rule, Interpretation C single-feature cadence exception bounded to foundation-data features, and Proposed→Accepted dual-commit governance protocol; Proposed at Day 1 Wave 1.1 schema-lock commit; Accepted at PR #181 merge (commit `8b7c7bf`) |
| Cross-reference link on top-level README | Additive edit | `README.md` | Update (1 link) | Spec FR-038a — single link to `schemas/taxonomy/README.md` |
| Cross-reference link on Tech Stack | Additive edit | `docs/architecture/00_Tech_Stack/README.md` | Update (1 link) | Spec FR-038b — single link under Schemas / Standards sections |

**Architectural posture**: additive-only with zero runtime surface-area touch. No existing agent, schema under `schemas/*.yaml` (excluding new `schemas/taxonomy/`), script, template, or example file is modified. The 5 non-agentic example PDFs (web-app, microservices, ascii-web-api, mermaid-agentic-app, free-text-microservice) regenerate byte-identically under `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000` per ADR-021 (spec FR-036 / SC-004 verified via `tests/scripts/test_backward_compatibility.py`). Zero new runtime dependencies — `pyyaml` and `pytest` were already declared in `requirements-dev.txt` per Feature 128.

**Scope amendments during implementation** (both recorded in ADR-027 Revision History):
- **NIST Subcategory count 68 → 72** (pm_signoff_amendment_1): Day 2 harvest of the authoritative NIST AI RMF 1.0 Playbook pages (airc.nist.gov, fetched 2026-04-17) surfaced 72 Subcategories (GOVERN 19 + MAP 18 + MEASURE 22 + MANAGE 13), not the 68 historically cited in the PRD era. Amendment approved under FR-024 primary-source-correction discipline; FR-022 transcribed IDs (MAP 4.2, MEASURE 2.6-2.10, MANAGE 1.3, MANAGE 2.4, GOVERN 1.4) remain within the 68-subset ⊂ 72-superset, so no ADR-025 or `nist-ai-rmf-mapping.md` edits required.
- **Surface C scope narrow 41 → 27 edges** (pm_signoff_amendment_2): T023 implementation surfaced that Surface C row identifiers (NIST AI 600-1 §2.X GAI Risks) are structurally distinct from AI RMF Subcategories per ADR-025's three-surface structure and cannot be represented under the closed 7-value `taxonomy` enum or in `nist-ai-rmf.yaml` (which holds AI RMF 1.0 Subcategories only). Option (c) selected: defer Surface C to follow-on Issue F-A1.1 which will add `nist-ai-600-1` as an 8th taxonomy enum value, author `schemas/taxonomy/nist-ai-600-1.yaml` with 12 GAI risk records, and transcribe the 15 Surface C Overlap rows as `tachi-stride-ai-category → nist-ai-600-1` edges. **Total NIST-derived edges in F-A1: 27 (Surface B only)**; Surface C transcription deferred to F-A1.1.

**Follow-on Issues filed on PR #181 merge**: (1) F-A1.1 — add `nist-ai-600-1` as 8th taxonomy enum value + author 12-record GAI Risk catalog + transcribe 15 Surface C edges (0.5-1 day, schema-minor additive release); (2) F-A1.2 — `related` and `superseded` edge expansion beyond the F-A1 `primary`-only floor; (3) F-A1.3 — periodic citation URL link-rot monitoring for the external-framework URLs recorded in the 526-edge crosswalk.

## Data Flow

**No runtime data flow changes.** F-A1 is a reference-data authoring feature. The data is consumed offline by adopter integrations and by downstream F-A2 / F-B features that have not yet shipped.

### Author-time flow (implementer's workflow)

```
Day 1 (parallel 3-agent execution — schema freeze + first catalog + spike)
  architect    → freeze schema via data-model.md + contracts/ + ADR-027 Proposed
  senior-backend-engineer → author owasp.yaml ≥60 items (6 OWASP lists)
  web-researcher → 50-edge diverse-slice spike (10 OWASP↔CWE + 10 ATT&CK↔CWE
                   + 10 ATT&CK↔ATLAS + 10 LLM↔NIST + 10 Agentic↔MITRE)
                 → measure per-edge authoring time → R3 tier decision
                   (Tier 1 default ≥500 / Tier 2 ≥300 / Tier 3 ≥150)

Day 2 (parallel — external frameworks + pseudo-taxonomies + citations)
  senior-backend-engineer → author mitre-attack.yaml (38 seed)
                           + mitre-atlas.yaml (7 seed + 5 curated Oct 2025)
                           + cwe.yaml (41 seed + 12 Top 25 2025)
                           + tachi-control-category.yaml (8 slugs)
                           + tachi-stride-ai-category.yaml (11 slugs)
                           + nist-ai-rmf.yaml start (→ 72 Subcategories)
  web-researcher → continue crosswalk citation discovery
  architect    → README.md draft + 2 cross-reference link edits

Day 3 (complete NIST + crosswalk assembly)
  senior-backend-engineer → complete nist-ai-rmf.yaml (72 records)
                           + author ~27 NIST Surface B edges (Surface C deferred per T027 Option c)
                           + assemble crosswalk records
  web-researcher → continue citation harvest toward ≥500
  architect    → finalize README

Day 4 (integrity tests + Accepted ADR + PR open)
  senior-backend-engineer → author tests/schemas/test_taxonomy_integrity.py
                           (authoring MUST occur AFTER all 8 YAMLs committed
                            per Architect F3 sequencing constraint)
  code-reviewer → backward-compat byte-identity verification
  architect    → ADR-027 Proposed→Accepted transition
  team-lead    → PR opened, 3 follow-on Issues filed

Day 5 (PR review + merge)
  PR #181 squash-merged to main (commit 8b7c7bf, 2026-04-17)
  T039 post-merge ADR-027 SHA fill → replaces <pending-T039-post-merge-fill>
```

### Consumer flow (adopter's workflow — post-merge)

```
Adopter integrating tachi output into a downstream system
  → pip install pyyaml
  → python: yaml.safe_load(open('schemas/taxonomy/owasp.yaml'))
  → iterate records to resolve an OWASP ID (e.g., LLM05) to canonical {id, full_id, name, url, cwe_refs}
  → yaml.safe_load(open('schemas/taxonomy/crosswalk.yaml'))
  → filter edges where source.taxonomy == 'owasp' && source.id == 'LLM05'
    to enumerate cross-framework mappings (CWE refs, MITRE ATT&CK
    adversary-objective links, NIST AI RMF subcategory coverage)
  → no text-parsing of agent markdown prose required
```

### Integrity enforcement flow (CI / maintainer workflow)

```
Contributor proposing a new crosswalk edge
  → pytest tests/schemas/test_taxonomy_integrity.py
  → test_framework_yamls_load — record-shape + uniqueness + URL/path validation
  → test_crosswalk_loads      — edge shape + no-duplicate (source, target, edge_type) 3-tuple
  → test_crosswalk_referential_integrity — every source.id / target.id resolves
                                          in the catalog named by source.taxonomy / target.taxonomy;
                                          every enum value in closed 7/3/3-value domains
  → test_citation_shape       — every citation non-empty + URL-regex OR existing file path
  → optional test_records_sorted — alphabetical by id within each catalog YAML;
                                   lexicographic on (source.taxonomy, source.id, target.taxonomy, target.id)
                                   for crosswalk edges; numeric-within-function sort for nist-ai-rmf.yaml
                                   (GOVERN, MANAGE, MAP, MEASURE alphabetical; then X.Y as 2-tuple of ints)
  → merge-time violation → PR blocked with per-finding error message
```

## Tech Stack

### New Dependencies

**None.** This feature introduces zero new runtime or development dependencies. Empty diff on `requirements*.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`. `pyyaml>=6.0` and `pytest>=8.0` were already declared in `requirements-dev.txt` per Feature 128 (Q7 / Assumption A6 verified at spec time).

### Tools Used (all pre-existing)

| Tool | Purpose | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
| YAML | Block-style data authoring for 7 catalog files + crosswalk | Native to repository (matches existing `schemas/finding.yaml` / `schemas/attack-chain.yaml` / `schemas/report.yaml` conventions) |
| `pyyaml` | `yaml.safe_load` parsing at integrity-test time and for adopter consumption | Pre-existing in `requirements-dev.txt` per Feature 128 |
| `pytest` | Integrity test suite harness | Pre-existing per Feature 128 |
| `pathlib.Path.is_file()` | Citation file-path existence check (stdlib) | Pre-existing Python 3.11 stdlib |
| `ADR-000-template.md` | ADR-027 authoring scaffold | Pre-existing governance template |

### Standards Consumed

`schemas/taxonomy/` catalog YAMLs reference the following external standards (no runtime dependency on any of them — data is transcribed from authoritative sources at authoring time):

- **OWASP LLM Top 10:2025**, **OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications:2026**, **OWASP Top 10:2021**, **OWASP API Security Top 10:2023**, **OWASP Mobile Top 10:2024**, **OWASP Machine Learning Security Top 10:2023**
- **MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise matrix** (38 seed techniques per Feature 082 detection-patterns.md baseline)
- **MITRE ATLAS v5.4** — includes the October 2025 agent techniques AML.T0058-T0062 (curated as a +5 extension beyond the 7-technique seed)
- **NIST AI 100-1 (NIST AI RMF 1.0)** — 72-Subcategory Playbook catalog per airc.nist.gov (primary-source-corrected from historical 68 per pm_signoff_amendment_1)
- **CWE Top 25 (2025)** — published 2025-12-11 by MITRE/CISA (+12 net-new entries beyond the 41-CWE seed)

**No runtime integration.** All 5 external standards are documented in `schemas/taxonomy/README.md` with per-framework provenance (seed source + count, external-curation source, what was added beyond the seed), canonical-URL conventions, and update procedures for future framework revisions. Runtime consumption begins in F-A2 (finding-level source attribution) and F-B (coverage attestation report section) — neither of which has shipped.

## Components

This feature does not add or modify runtime components. The deliverable is a content-only example directory that doubles as an integration-test / regression fixture for the MAESTRO pipeline.

| Component | Type | File Path | Change Type | Rationale |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Canonical MAESTRO reference example | New example directory | `examples/maestro-reference/` | Create (content-only) | Spec FR-001/FR-002/FR-003 — adopter-facing canonical walkthrough spanning all 7 MAESTRO layers |
| Hand-authored architecture input | New Mermaid architecture | `examples/maestro-reference/architecture.md` | Create | Spec FR-002/FR-004/FR-005 — 18-component Healthcare CDSS multi-agent scenario satisfying Pre-Execution Architecture Review Checklist (multi-agent gate predicate TRUE; R-01/R-02/R-03 preconditions green) |
| Adopter-facing tour | New README | `examples/maestro-reference/README.md` | Create | Spec FR-003 — 7 required sections (introduction, domain overview with disclaimer, MAESTRO layer coverage table, what to look for in output, reading-order recommendation, compliance posture cross-references to ADR-024 + ADR-025, limitations) |
| Feature 120 version frontmatter | Injected YAML frontmatter | `examples/maestro-reference/architecture.md` (frontmatter block) | Inject last | Spec FR-012 / SC-012 — version "1.0", SHA-256 body checksum, `/tachi.architecture` "create" mode on frozen body |
| Pipeline-generated outputs | Full output artifact set | `examples/maestro-reference/{threats.md, threats.sarif, threat-report.md, risk-scores.md, risk-scores.sarif, compensating-controls.md, compensating-controls.sarif, attack-trees/, attack-chains.md, 6× infographic JPEGs + specs, security-report.pdf, security-report.pdf.baseline}` | Generated | Spec FR-006/FR-007/FR-008 — standard pipeline invocation; demonstrates MAESTRO layer coverage (7/7), cross-layer attack chains (≥1 chain ≥3 layers), agentic pattern analysis (≥3 of 6 canonical patterns) |
| Byte-deterministic PDF baseline | New baseline file | `examples/maestro-reference/security-report.pdf.baseline` | Create | Spec FR-009 / SC-007 — byte-identical regeneration under `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000` per ADR-021 |
| Top-level examples README update | Modify existing file | `examples/README.md` | Update (additive) | Spec FR-010 / SC-006 — canonical MAESTRO walkthrough positioned as recommended first-read for MAESTRO users; existing 6 examples retain listings |
| Backward-compatibility regression fixture | Modify existing test | `tests/scripts/test_backward_compatibility.py` (`BASELINE_EXAMPLES`) | Update (additive) | Spec FR-011 / SC-013 — adds `maestro-reference` as 6th baseline alongside the existing 5 non-multi-agent baselines; conditional on mmdc CI availability (verified in Wave 0) |

**Architectural posture**: additive-only. No existing agent, schema, template, script, or ADR is modified. The five existing non-multi-agent baselines (web-app, microservices, ascii-web-api, mermaid-agentic-app, free-text-microservice) remain byte-identical under `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000` per ADR-021 (spec FR-013 / SC-008). The `agentic-app` example is unchanged (spec FR-014 / SC-009). The 11 STRIDE+AI detection agents stabilized in Feature 082 are unchanged per the zero-edit invariant (ADR-023); the orchestrator is unchanged.

**Strategic positioning**: The maestro-reference example is the canonical first-read teaching artifact that demonstrates the complete MAESTRO umbrella produced end-to-end by a single pipeline run — Phase 1 layer-tagged findings (Features 084/136), Phase 2 cross-layer attack chains (Feature 141), Phase 3 agentic pattern classifications (Feature 142), and Phase 4 + 5 compliance posture (Features 143/144 via ADR-024 + ADR-025 cross-references in the README). It closes the "read this first" gap in tachi's MAESTRO documentation surface. The example is purpose-built to naturally exercise multi-layer chains and multi-pattern findings (≥14 components across all 7 layers, inter-agent data flows, persistent-state components, emergent-behavior descriptions), so future MAESTRO feature work (Phase 2 chain refactor, Phase 3 pattern synthesis tuning, future phases) has a validated regression target without architectural contortion.

## Data Flow

**No runtime data flow changes.** The feature is purely content authoring consuming the existing pipeline.

### Author-time flow (implementer's workflow)

```
Wave 0 (Domain + Structure + CI gates — ≤2h timebox)
  architect + team-lead + PM → lock: domain (Healthcare CDSS),
                                     structure (flat top-level per Y),
                                     mmdc CI availability (verified present)

Wave 1 (Architecture Authorship)
  architect → draft architecture.md body (18 components, 7 layers)
           → static-verify Pre-Execution Architecture Review Checklist:
               (a) multi-agent gate predicate TRUE
               (b) R-01 precondition (inter-agent data flow present)
               (c) R-02 precondition (persistent-state component present)
               (d) R-03 precondition (multi-agent topology + emergent-behavior keywords)
           → freeze body
           → /tachi.architecture create-mode → inject Feature 120 frontmatter last

Wave 2 (Pipeline Invocation — standard command sequence)
  /tachi.threat-model → threats.md + threats.sarif (Phase 1 layer tags, Phase 3 patterns, Phase 3.5 chains)
  /tachi.risk-score → risk-scores.md + risk-scores.sarif (4-dimensional composite per ADR-018)
  /tachi.compensating-controls → compensating-controls.md + .sarif (scanned against tachi repo codebase)
  /tachi.infographic all → 6× JPEGs + co-committed specs
  /tachi.security-report → security-report.pdf + security-report.pdf.baseline

Wave 3 (Adopter-Facing README)
  architect → hand-author README.md with 7 required sections
           → PM reviews for neutral factual tone before commit

Wave 4 (Regression-Fixture Integration — conditional)
  IF mmdc CI available (Wave 0 gate green):
    devops → append "maestro-reference" to BASELINE_EXAMPLES in tests/scripts/test_backward_compatibility.py
          → commit baseline PDF under SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000
          → verify byte-identity on rerun
  ELSE:
    FR-011 deferred to follow-up PR per Risk 145.3 contingency

Wave 5 (Top-Level examples/README.md Update)
  architect → add "maestro-reference" row to Standardized Examples table
           → add prominent first-read callout near top of examples/README.md
           → preserve all 6 existing example listings
```

### Read-time flow (adopter's workflow — post-merge)

```
Security engineer evaluating tachi for MAESTRO
  → opens examples/README.md → sees first-read callout pointing at maestro-reference
  → opens examples/maestro-reference/README.md → reads 7-section tour
  → follows reading-order recommendation to threats.md → threat-report.md → attack-chains.md → PDF
  → cross-references ADR-024 (AIVSS posture) + ADR-025 (NIST AI RMF posture) for compliance context
  → optionally inspects architecture.md for component-to-MAESTRO-layer lineage
```

### Regression flow (CI / maintainer workflow)

```
Maintainer adding new MAESTRO-adjacent feature
  → runs pytest tests/scripts/test_backward_compatibility.py with SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000
  → maestro-reference is parametrized alongside the other 5 baselines
  → pytest compiles each architecture through the full PDF pipeline
  → compares output byte-for-byte against each committed *.pdf.baseline
  → all 7 MAESTRO layers populated, ≥1 cross-layer chain surfaced, ≥3 agentic patterns populated — regression target invariant
```

### Feature 001: Project Skeleton & Interface Contract

## Components

### Component 1: Agent Prompt Files (Hub)

**Location**: `agents/`
**Type**: New files (11 agent prompts + 1 placeholder)
**Purpose**: Immutable threat agent definitions — the content hub that all outputs derive from.

- `agents/stride/` — 6 STRIDE agents (spoofing, tampering, repudiation, info-disclosure, denial-of-service, privilege-escalation)
- `agents/ai/` — 5 AI agents (prompt-injection, tool-abuse, data-poisoning, model-theft, agent-autonomy)
- `agents/ai/README.md` — 5-agent-to-2-table mapping: AG (agent-autonomy, tool-abuse) and LLM (prompt-injection, data-poisoning, model-theft)
- `agents/orchestrator.md` — Placeholder for F-002

### Component 2: Machine-Readable Schemas

### Feature 003: Orchestrator Agent

## Components

### Component 1: Orchestrator Prompt File

**File**: `agents/orchestrator.md`
**Type**: Replace placeholder (Feature 001 placeholder replaced with full implementation)
**Purpose**: Central prompt implementing OWASP 4-step threat modeling workflow — parse, classify, dispatch, assemble.

**Internal Structure** (prompt sections):

| Section | OWASP Phase | Responsibility |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Frontmatter | — | Agent metadata (agent_name, category, status, version) with explicit references to all schemas, templates, and agent files |
| Role & Purpose | — | Establish orchestrator identity, platform-neutrality, and output constraints |
| Input Sanitization Boundary | — | Mark architecture input as data, not instructions; reject prompt injection attempts within `<architecture-input>` tags |
| Output Format Specification | — | Define 7-section structure (System Overview, Trust Boundaries, STRIDE Tables x6, AI Tables x2, Coverage Matrix, Risk Summary, Recommended Actions) with YAML frontmatter |
| Phase 1: Scope | Scope | Format detection (5 formats with heuristic priority), component extraction with format-specific parsers, DFD classification (4 element types with ambiguous-default-to-Process rule), trust boundary identification, System Overview assembly, **Component Inventory intermediate output with self-check** |
| Phase 2: Determine Threats | Determine Threats | STRIDE-per-Element normalization table (DFD type to applicable categories), AI keyword dispatch rules (LLM keywords, AG keywords, dual-dispatch), agent invocation protocol (parallel + sequential modes with full architecture context payload), **Dispatch Table intermediate output with self-check** |
| Phase 3: Determine Countermeasures | Determine Countermeasures | Agent finding collection, risk_level validation against OWASP 3x3 matrix with correction protocol, STRIDE table assembly (6 tables), AI table assembly (2 tables via 5-agent-to-2-table mapping) |
| Phase 4: Assess | Assess | Coverage matrix generation (finding counts, dash for analyzed-but-clean, empty for not-applicable), risk summary computation (percentages rounded to 1 decimal), recommended actions list (sorted by risk descending, then table order) |
| Error Handling | — | Three terminal errors: UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT (auto-detection fails), NO_COMPONENTS (parsing finds no components or data flows), INVALID_FORMAT_VALUE (format field not in allowed enum); two non-terminal handlers: ambiguous classification annotation, non-conforming finding correction |
| Output Validation | — | Structural integrity checklist: 7 sections present, frontmatter valid, finding IDs sequential, all fields populated, risk levels consistent with OWASP 3x3, cross-section counts match |

### Feature 005: STRIDE Threat Agents

**Status**: Delivered (2026-03-22) | PR #6 | 41/41 tasks complete

## Components

### Component 1: 6 STRIDE Threat Agent Definitions

**Location**: `agents/stride/`
**Type**: Enhanced existing files (Feature 001 skeleton refined and validated)
**Purpose**: Each agent analyzes architecture input through exactly one STRIDE threat lens, producing component-specific findings conforming to `schemas/finding.yaml`.

| Agent File | Threat Class | DFD Targets | ID Prefix | Key Detection Patterns |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------------------|
| `spoofing.md` | Spoofing (S) | External Entity, Process | S-N | Authentication bypass, credential theft/replay, session hijacking, service impersonation, federated identity attacks |
| `tampering.md` | Tampering (T) | Process, Data Store, Data Flow | T-N | Input validation bypass, data integrity violations, message/payload manipulation, storage tampering, configuration tampering |
| `repudiation.md` | Repudiation (R) | External Entity, Process | R-N | Audit logging gaps, log integrity failures, non-repudiation mechanism absence, timestamp manipulation |
| `info-disclosure.md` | Information Disclosure (I) | Process, Data Store, Data Flow | I-N | Data leaks via error messages, excessive API responses, side-channel exposure, storage access control gaps, transit encryption gaps |
| `denial-of-service.md` | Denial of Service (D) | Process, Data Store, Data Flow | D-N | Resource exhaustion, queue/connection pool saturation, storage flooding, algorithmic complexity attacks, cascading failures |
| `privilege-escalation.md` | Elevation of Privilege (E) | Process | E-N | RBAC/ABAC bypass, horizontal/vertical escalation, default permission over-grants, parameter tampering for privilege gain |

**Agent structure** (canonical per-agent organization):
- YAML frontmatter: `agent_name`, `category`, `threat_class`, `dfd_targets`, `owasp_references`, `output_schema`
- Purpose section: Threat class definition and DFD targeting rationale
- Detection Scope: Targeted DFD element types with patterns and indicators (4-6 subcategories)
- AI-Specific Threat Patterns: Agentic application extensions per STRIDE category
- Finding Template: Concrete example demonstrating component-specific findings
- Risk Computation: OWASP 3x3 matrix application with likelihood/impact guidance
- References: OWASP Top 10 2021, OWASP API Security 2023, CWE, MITRE ATT&CK identifiers

### Component 2: AI-Specific Threat Pattern Extensions

**Location**: Within each `agents/stride/*.md` agent file
**Type**: New sections within existing agents
**Purpose**: Extend classic STRIDE patterns with threats specific to agentic AI applications.

Each STRIDE agent includes an "AI-Specific Threat Patterns" section covering:
- **Spoofing**: LLM API key theft, model identity spoofing, prompt-based identity assumption
- **Tampering**: Training data poisoning, RAG context manipulation, tool response modification
- **Repudiation**: Agentic action audit gaps, tool call logging, autonomous decision accountability
- **Info Disclosure**: Model inversion attacks, embedding leakage, context window data exposure
- **DoS**: LLM token exhaustion, recursive agent loops, unbounded tool execution chains
- **Privilege Escalation**: Agent capability boundary violations, tool permission escalation, MCP server scope creep

### Component 3: OWASP API Security 2023 Cross-References

**Location**: YAML frontmatter `owasp_references` field in each agent file
**Type**: Enhanced metadata
**Purpose**: Cross-reference STRIDE findings with OWASP API Security Top 10 2023 (API1-API10) alongside existing OWASP Top 10 2021, CWE, and MITRE ATT&CK references.

### Agent Validation Framework

The validation approach (used during Feature 005 delivery) has three layers:

**Layer 1: Structural Audit** (per agent)
- Frontmatter fields present and correct (`agent_name`, `category`, `threat_class`, `dfd_targets`, `owasp_references`, `output_schema`)
- Section structure matches canonical organization (purpose, detection scope, patterns, finding template, risk computation, references)
- `dfd_targets` matches STRIDE-per-Element matrix row for this category

**Layer 2: Content Quality** (per agent)
- Detection patterns cover all attack subcategories from PRD FR-7
- Finding template examples demonstrate component-specific threats (not generic)
- Mitigation examples are actionable with specific technology references
- Framework references include OWASP, CWE, and MITRE ATT&CK identifiers

**Layer 3: Integration Validation** (all agents together)
- Run orchestrator against `examples/mermaid-agentic-app/input.md`
- Verify all 6 STRIDE tables have findings in assembled `threats.md`
- Verify coverage matrix shows correct STRIDE-per-Element targeting
- Verify 100% component specificity (zero generic findings)

### STRIDE-per-Element Validation Matrix

| DFD Element | S | T | R | I | D | E |

- Section structure matches canonical organization (purpose, detection scope, patterns, finding template, risk computation, references)
- `dfd_targets` matches interface contract AI extension dispatch rules

**Layer 2: Content Quality** (per agent)
- Detection patterns cover all attack subcategories from PRD FR-8
- Finding template examples demonstrate component-specific threats (not generic)
- Mitigation examples are actionable with specific technology references
- Framework references include OWASP AI framework IDs (LLM0x:2025, ASI-xx, MCP-xx:2025)

**Layer 3: Integration Validation** (all agents together)
- Run orchestrator against `examples/mermaid-agentic-app/input.md`
- Verify AG and LLM tables have findings in assembled `threats.md`
- Verify two-layer keyword dispatch and dual-dispatch behavior
- Verify 100% component specificity (zero generic findings)

1. SARIF Generation Instructions
2. Finding IR → SARIF Result Mapping Table (FR-003)
3. Category → Rule ID Mapping Table (FR-004, resolves `info-disclosure` → `information-disclosure`)
4. Severity Mapping Table (FR-005, Note-level fix: `note`/`"0.1"`)
5. SARIF Tool Metadata Template (FR-006)
6. Rule Definition Templates (8 categories with shortDescription, fullDescription, help.text, help.markdown, tags)
7. Correlated Finding Instructions (FR-007, `relatedLocations[]`)
8. Fingerprint Computation (FR-008, SHA-256 of ruleId + component_name)
9. Dual-Location Instructions (FR-011, physicalLocation + logicalLocations)
10. JSON Structural Self-Check (FR-010)

### Component 2: Output Schema Note-Level Fix

**File**: `schemas/output.yaml`
**Type**: Modify existing SARIF Severity Mapping comment block
**Purpose**: Fix Note-level mapping from `none`/`0.0` to `note`/`0.1` per Architect review.

### Feature 018: Threat Infographic Agent

**Status**: Delivered (2026-03-23) | PR #19 | 18/18 tasks complete

## Components

### Component 1: Infographic Agent Prompt (`agents/threat-infographic.md`)

**Purpose**: Markdown prompt file that defines the infographic agent's data extraction methodology, specification format, Gemini API prompt construction, and graceful fallback behavior. Invoked via the standalone `/tachi.infographic` command (Feature 039); no longer dispatched by the orchestrator pipeline. Supports three data source extraction paths (Feature 048): `compensating-controls.md` (residual risk from Coverage Matrix sub-tables + co-located `threats.md`), `risk-scores.md` (inherent risk composite scores + co-located `threats.md`), or `threats.md` standalone (qualitative severity counts). Risk labels adapt to source type: "Residual Risk", "Inherent Risk", or "Severity".

**Follows Existing Pattern**: 8-section YAML+Markdown structure matching `agents/threat-report.md` (F-015).

### Component 2: Infographic Output Schema (`schemas/infographic.yaml`)

**Purpose**: Defines the structural validation contract for `threat-infographic-spec.md`, enabling automated completeness checks. Covers 6 required sections: Metadata, Risk Distribution, Coverage Heat Map, Top Critical Findings, Architecture Threat Overlay, and Visual Design Directives.

### Component 3: Standalone `/tachi.infographic` Command (Feature 039)

**Purpose**: Infographic generation extracted from the orchestrator pipeline into a standalone `/tachi.infographic` command (Feature 039). The command auto-detects the richest available data source using a three-tier hierarchy: `compensating-controls.md` > `risk-scores.md` > `threats.md` (Feature 048). Supports explicit file override with content-based type detection and template selection. Enhancement tips guide users toward richer pipeline tiers. The orchestrator pipeline now runs 5 phases only (Phases 1-5). See Feature 039 section below for the standalone command architecture.

### Feature 021: Platform Adapters

**Status**: Delivered (2026-03-23) | PR #22 | 40/40 tasks complete

## Architecture Pattern: Hub-and-Spoke Distribution

Feature 021 introduces a **platform adapter layer** that extends tachi's existing hub-and-spoke content model to multi-platform distribution. The core agents (`agents/`) remain the immutable hub -- the single source of truth for all 14 threat agent prompts. Each adapter is a spoke that transforms hub content into a platform-native format without modifying source agent logic.

**Key architectural principles**:
- **Content preservation**: All file-transformation adapters preserve 100% of prompt content. Only metadata format, file extensions, and internal path references change during transformation.
- **Two adapter categories**: File-transformation adapters (Claude Code, Generic, Cursor, Copilot) produce static files for installation into target platform directories. The CI integration adapter (GitHub Actions) invokes agents at runtime via LLM API -- no file transformation occurs.
- **Metadata translation**: Platform-specific frontmatter replaces tachi YAML frontmatter. Tachi-specific metadata (category, threat_class, dfd_targets, owasp_references, output_schema) is preserved in a `## Metadata` body section for file-transformation adapters that support frontmatter (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot). The generic adapter strips all metadata for self-contained prompts.
- **Path rewriting**: Internal references (schemas, templates, sibling agents) are rewritten based on installation depth from project root. See `specs/021-platform-adapters/conventions.md` for the complete rule set.
- **Drift detection**: Each adapter includes a `VERSION` manifest (source commit SHA, generation timestamp, per-agent SHA-256 checksums) generated by `scripts/generate-adapter-version.sh`.
- **Size-aware splitting**: Copilot enforces a ~30K character limit per agent file. Oversized agents (orchestrator at ~120K chars, threat-report at ~43K chars) are split into a compact `.agent.md` file plus a `.github/instructions/` companion file with the full context.

See [ADR-015](../02_ADRs/ADR-015-platform-adapter-hub-and-spoke-distribution.md) for the formal architectural decision record.

## Components

### Component 1: Adapter Directory Structure

**Location**: `adapters/{platform-name}/` (5 subdirectories under existing `adapters/`)
**Type**: New subdirectories
**Purpose**: Platform-specific transformations of core agents into native formats for Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, GitHub Actions, and generic LLM usage.

Each adapter contains: platform-specific agent files, installation README, VERSION manifest.

### Component 2: Claude Code Adapter (P0)

**Location**: `adapters/claude-code/`
**Purpose**: Maps 14 agents into `.claude/agents/tachi/` format with Claude Code frontmatter (`name`, `description`). Tachi metadata relocated to `## Metadata` body section. Supports parallel dispatch via Agent tool. Single `cp -r` installation.

### Component 3: Generic Adapter (P0)

**Location**: `adapters/generic/`
**Purpose**: Self-contained numbered prompt files (`00-orchestrator.md` through `13-threat-infographic.md`). Frontmatter stripped, `{{ARCHITECTURE_INPUT}}` placeholders added. Orchestrator converted to sequential workflow guide (justified FR-002 exception). Two usage modes: chat UI copy-paste and programmatic API invocation.

### Component 4: Cursor Adapter (P1)

**Location**: `adapters/cursor/`
**Purpose**: Maps agents to `.cursor/rules/tachi/` as `.mdc` rule files. Orchestrator is `alwaysApply: true`; threat agents are Agent Requested. Behavioral difference: passive context injection, not active dispatch.

### Component 5: Copilot Adapter (P1)

**Location**: `adapters/copilot/`
**Purpose**: Maps agents to `.github/agents/tachi/` as `.agent.md` files. Size constraint handling: orchestrator (120K chars) and threat-report (43K chars) split into compact agent + `.github/instructions/` file. All other agents (5-13K) fit within 30K limit.

### Component 6: GitHub Actions Adapter (P1)

**Location**: `adapters/github-actions/`
**Purpose**: CI workflow (`tachi-threat-model.yml`) triggering on architecture file changes. Invokes orchestrator via LLM API, generates `threats.md` + `threats.sarif`, uploads SARIF to GitHub Code Scanning. Architecturally distinct from file-transformation adapters.

### Component 7: VERSION File

**Location**: `adapters/{platform}/VERSION`
**Purpose**: Drift detection manifest with source commit SHA, generation date, and per-agent SHA-256 checksums.

### Feature 035: Quantitative Risk Scoring

## Components

### Component 1: Risk Score Command

**File**: `.claude/commands/tachi.risk-score.md`
**Type**: New file
**Purpose**: `/tachi.risk-score` command definition — flag parsing, input validation, agent invocation, output summary. Follows the `/tachi.threat-model` command pattern.

### Component 2: Risk Scorer Agent

**File**: `.claude/agents/tachi/risk-scorer.md`
**Type**: New file
**Purpose**: Core scoring agent — parses threat findings, assesses 4 dimensions (CVSS 3.1, exploitability, scalability, reachability), calculates weighted composite, attaches governance fields, generates dual output.

### Component 3: Risk Scoring Schema

**File**: `schemas/risk-scoring.yaml`
**Type**: New file
**Purpose**: Scored finding schema extending `finding.yaml` with scoring dimensions, composite weights, category-level CVSS defaults, and severity band definitions aligned with `output.yaml`.

### Component 4: Output Templates

**Files**: `templates/tachi/output-schemas/risk-scores.md`, `templates/tachi/output-schemas/risk-scores.sarif`
**Type**: New files
**Purpose**: Markdown template (executive summary, scored threat table, methodology section) and SARIF template (extended property bag with per-finding composite scores and governance fields).

### Component 5: Adapter Distribution

**Files**: `adapters/claude-code/commands/tachi.risk-score.md`, `adapters/claude-code/agents/risk-scorer.md`
**Type**: New files
**Purpose**: Adapter copies for Claude Code distribution, following existing adapter pattern.

## Data Flow

### Feature 039: Standalone Infographic Command

## Components

### Component 1: `/tachi.infographic` Command (NEW)

**File**: `.claude/commands/tachi.infographic.md`
**Pattern**: Follows `/tachi.risk-score` command structure (Step 0 → Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3)

Steps: Parse flags (`--template`, `--output-dir`) → Detect richest data source via three-tier hierarchy (`compensating-controls.md` > `risk-scores.md` > `threats.md`) → Display enhancement tip for next tier → Invoke infographic agent in fresh context → Report results.

### Component 2: Infographic Agent Enhancement (MODIFY)

**File**: `.claude/agents/tachi/threat-infographic.md`
**Change**: Three-path data extraction (Feature 048) — supports `compensating-controls.md` (residual risk from Coverage Matrix sub-tables), `risk-scores.md` (inherent risk composite scores), or `threats.md` (qualitative severity). When `compensating-controls.md` or `risk-scores.md` is primary, reads co-located `threats.md` for structural/spatial data. Risk labels adapt to source type ("Residual Risk" / "Inherent Risk" / "Severity").

### Component 3: /tachi.threat-model Pipeline Cleanup (MODIFY)

**File**: `.claude/commands/tachi.threat-model.md`
**Change**: Remove Phase 6 (infographic generation), associated flags (`--infographic-template`, `--skip-infographic`), and `TACHI_SKIP_INFOGRAPHIC` env var. Add post-pipeline hint directing users to `/tachi.infographic`.

### Component 4: Orchestrator Phase 6 Removal (MODIFY)

**File**: `.claude/agents/tachi/orchestrator.md`
**Change**: Remove Phase 6 dispatch section, update pipeline phase count from 6 to 5.

### Component 5: Platform Adapter Updates (MODIFY)

Update all adapter variants (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, Generic) for orchestrator, threat-model command, and infographic agent to reflect 5-phase pipeline and dual-path extraction.

### Feature 048: Infographic Tiered Pipeline Auto-Detection & Residual Risk

**Status**: Delivered (2026-03-28) | PR #49 | 27/27 tasks complete

## Components

### Component 1: `/tachi.infographic` Command — Three-Tier Detection (MODIFY)

**File**: `.claude/commands/tachi.infographic.md`
**Change**: Extended two-tier auto-detection to three-tier hierarchy (`compensating-controls.md` > `risk-scores.md` > `threats.md`). Added content-based type detection for explicit paths (Coverage Matrix header + Residual Score column). Added tiered enhancement tips guiding users toward richer pipeline tiers. Updated error messages to list all three expected file formats. Extended co-location check to trigger for `compensating-controls.md` (same pattern as `risk-scores.md`). Detection-level failures fall through gracefully; extraction-level failures halt with warning.

### Component 2: Infographic Agent — Compensating Controls Extraction Path (MODIFY)

**File**: `.claude/agents/tachi/threat-infographic.md`
**Change**: Added third data source extraction path for `compensating-controls.md`. Residual risk scores extracted from Coverage Matrix sub-tables (Critical, High, Medium, Low severity bands). Risk labels adapt to source type: "Residual Risk" (compensating-controls), "Inherent Risk" (risk-scores), "Severity" (threats). Baseball-card template includes risk reduction percentage in summary zone when compensating-controls is the source. Agent metadata updated with `compensating-controls` data source type declaration.

### Feature 054: Security Assessment PDF Booklet

## Components

### Component 1: Command File (`security-report.md`)

User-facing entry point following the 4-step command pattern (parse → validate → generate → report). Handles `--output-dir` and `--title` flags, validates Typst installation, auto-detects 8 artifact types in target directory (including `attack-trees/` directory, Feature 112), and invokes the report-assembler agent.

### Component 2: Agent File (`report-assembler.md`)

Orchestrates the report generation pipeline: invokes `scripts/extract-report-data.py` for deterministic markdown-to-Typst data extraction (Feature 067 replaced inline LLM parsing), then invokes `typst compile` to produce `security-report.pdf`. The Python script handles all artifact parsing (YAML frontmatter, markdown tables, section content), 3-tier data source preference for Findings Detail, severity counting, scope extraction, and internal consistency validation.

### Component 3: Schema File (`security-report.yaml`)

Declarative page assembly rules defining artifact detection patterns, page sequence, page dimensions (US Letter portrait + custom 16:9 landscape), data source tiers with tier-specific columns, and conditional inclusion rules.

### Component 4: Typst Templates (`templates/tachi/security-report/`)

Modular rendering templates: `main.typ` (orchestrator with conditional page inclusion), `shared.typ` (severity colors, typography, headers/footers), and per-page modules (`cover.typ`, `executive-summary.typ`, `full-bleed.typ`, `findings-detail.typ`, `control-coverage.typ`, `remediation-roadmap.typ`, `attack-path.typ` -- Feature 112).

### Feature 067: Deterministic Report Data Extraction

## Components

### Component 1: Python Extraction Script (`scripts/extract-report-data.py`)

**Type**: New file
**Purpose**: Deterministic, stdlib-only Python 3.9+ script that replaces LLM-based markdown parsing in the report-assembler agent. Parses all 4 pipeline markdown artifacts (threats.md, risk-scores.md, compensating-controls.md, threat-report.md) using regex-based extraction and writes a complete Typst data file (report-data.typ) with all variable bindings.

Key properties:
- **Byte-identical output**: Same inputs always produce the same report-data.typ (no LLM variance)
- **3-tier severity source**: Tier 1 compensating-controls.md, Tier 2 risk-scores.md, Tier 3 threats.md
- **Internal consistency validation**: Severity sum checks, scope count checks, unique finding ID checks
- **Exit codes**: 0 success, 1 missing required artifact, 2 validation failure

### Component 2: Report Assembler Agent Update (`report-assembler.md`)

**Type**: Modified
**Purpose**: Updated to invoke the Python script instead of performing inline LLM parsing. The agent now handles artifact detection, script invocation, and Typst compilation, while all data extraction is delegated to the deterministic script.

## Data Flow

```
threats.md + optional artifacts (risk-scores.md, compensating-controls.md, threat-report.md)
    → Report Assembler (artifact detection)
    → python3 scripts/extract-report-data.py --target-dir <dir> --output-dir <dir>
    → report-data.typ (deterministic, byte-identical on same inputs)
    → Typst compile (main.typ orchestrates page types)
    → security-report.pdf
```

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Version | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Python | 3.9+ (stdlib only) | Deterministic markdown parsing and Typst data generation; zero external dependencies |

### Feature 071: Deterministic Infographic Data Extraction

## Components

### Component 1: Shared Parser Module (`scripts/tachi_parsers.py`)

**Type**: New file (extracted from Feature 067's `extract-report-data.py`)
**Purpose**: Shared parser module (~750 lines) providing deterministic parsers for markdown tables, YAML frontmatter, severity distributions, findings, scope data, and compensating controls. Both `extract-report-data.py` and `extract-infographic-data.py` import the same parsing functions, guaranteeing identical interpretation of the same source artifacts across report and infographic pipelines.

Key exports:
- **Table parsing**: `parse_markdown_table()`, `_find_table_with_column()`
- **Frontmatter**: `parse_frontmatter()`, `parse_project_name()`
- **Artifact detection**: `detect_artifacts()`, `determine_tier()`
- **Severity**: `parse_threats_severity()`, `parse_risk_scores_severity()`
- **Findings**: `parse_threats_findings()`, `parse_risk_scores_findings()`
- **Scope/controls**: `parse_scope_data()`, `parse_compensating_controls_md()`, `parse_component_distribution()`
- **Constants**: `SEVERITY_ORDER`, `STRIDE_PREFIXES`, exit codes

### Component 2: Infographic Extraction Script (`scripts/extract-infographic-data.py`)

**Type**: New file (~1,060 lines)
**Purpose**: Deterministic, stdlib-only Python 3.9+ script that replaces LLM-based data extraction in the threat-infographic agent. Parses pipeline markdown artifacts and writes JSON data files with all variable bindings needed by infographic templates (baseball-card, system-architecture, risk-funnel).

Key properties:
- **Byte-identical output**: Same inputs always produce the same JSON (no LLM variance)
- **3-tier data source auto-detection**: Tier 1 compensating-controls.md, Tier 2 risk-scores.md, Tier 3 threats.md
- **Largest Remainder Method**: Integer percentage rounding guaranteeing sums equal exactly 100, with deterministic tie-breaking (lexicographic label order)
- **Per-template data**: Generates template-specific `template_data` object (risk weights for baseball-card, architecture overlay for system-architecture, funnel stages for risk-funnel)
- **Internal consistency validation**: Severity sum checks, finding ID cross-checks, heat map total consistency
- **Exit codes**: 0 success, 1 missing required artifact, 2 validation failure

### Component 3: Threat-Infographic Agent Update (`agents/threat-infographic.md`)

**Type**: Modified
**Purpose**: Updated to invoke the Python extraction script instead of performing inline LLM-based data extraction. The agent now runs `scripts/extract-infographic-data.py`, reads the resulting JSON, and generates the infographic specification. No manual fallback is permitted on script failure (exit code 1 or 2).

### Component 4: Refactored Report Extraction Script (`scripts/extract-report-data.py`)

**Type**: Modified
**Purpose**: Refactored to import shared parsers from `tachi_parsers.py` instead of containing inline implementations. All parsing logic moved to the shared module; the script retains only Typst-specific output formatting.

## Data Flow

```
threats.md + optional artifacts (risk-scores.md, compensating-controls.md)
    → Infographic Agent (template selection)
    → python3 scripts/extract-infographic-data.py --target-dir <dir> --template <name> --output <path>
        → tachi_parsers.py (shared parsing: frontmatter, tables, severity, findings, scope)
    → infographic-data.json (deterministic, byte-identical on same inputs)
    → Agent reads JSON and generates specification
    → threat-{template-name}-spec.md + optional threat-{template-name}.jpg (Gemini API)
```

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Version | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Python | 3.9+ (stdlib only) | Deterministic markdown parsing and JSON data generation; zero external dependencies |
| JSON | N/A | Structured data interchange between extraction script and infographic agent |

### Feature 074: Baseline-Aware Pipeline

**Status**: Delivered (2026-04-01) | PR #79 | 36/36 tasks complete

## Components

### Component 1: Schema Extensions

**Files modified**: `schemas/finding.yaml`, `schemas/risk-scoring.yaml`, `schemas/compensating-controls.yaml`
**Type**: Extended existing schemas with baseline-aware fields
**Purpose**: Extend the finding IR chain (finding -> scored_finding -> controlled_finding) with delta tracking and score inheritance fields.

| Schema | New Fields | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `finding.yaml` | `delta_status` (NEW/UNCHANGED/UPDATED/RESOLVED), `baseline_run_id` (nullable string) | Finding lifecycle tracking relative to baseline |
| `risk-scoring.yaml` | `score_source` (inherited/fresh), `score_bounds` (min/max object, nullable) | Score inheritance for stable findings, bounded scoring for new findings |
| `compensating-controls.yaml` | `control_carry_forward` (boolean), `rescan_scope` (full/incremental) | Control status inheritance and incremental re-scan scoping |

### Component 2: Coverage Checklists Schema

**File**: `schemas/coverage-checklists.yaml`
**Type**: New file
**Purpose**: Static configuration defining minimum required threat categories per DFD element type. Consumed by the orchestrator's coverage gate (Phase 4) to verify that all required threat categories have been evaluated for each component.

6 component types:
- **Standard DFD types** (4): external_entity (S, R), process (all 6 STRIDE), data_store (T, I, D), data_flow (T, I, D)
- **AI subtypes** (2): llm_process (all STRIDE + llm, detected via keywords: llm, language model, gpt, claude, ai model, inference), mcp_server (all STRIDE + agentic, detected via keywords: mcp, model context protocol, tool server, plugin host)

AI subtype detection takes precedence over standard type when keywords match.

### Component 3: Orchestrator Agent Enhancement

**File modified**: `.claude/agents/tachi/orchestrator.md`
**Type**: Extended existing agent with 4-phase baseline pipeline
**Purpose**: Transform the stateless OWASP pipeline into a baseline-aware pipeline with finding stability, delta annotations, and coverage assurance.

New/modified phases:
- **Phase 0 (new)**: Baseline Detection -- detect baseline from `--baseline` flag or auto-detect existing `threats.md` in output directory. Parse finding registry with fingerprint extraction. Graceful degradation to stateless mode on invalid baseline.
- **Phase 1 (modified)**: Carry-Forward -- verify each baseline finding against current architecture, classify as UNCHANGED/UPDATED/RESOLVED. Build coverage summary (component -> covered categories).
- **Phase 2 (modified)**: Isolated Discovery -- spawn discovery context with architecture + coverage summary only (no full finding text, preventing anchoring bias). Discover uncovered component-category pairs.
- **Phase 3 (new)**: Merge + Dedup -- match Phase 2 findings against baseline by (component, threat_category, primaryLocationLineHash). Duplicate findings discarded (baseline version wins). New findings assigned sequential IDs continuing from highest existing per category.
- **Phase 4 (new)**: Coverage Gate -- load `schemas/coverage-checklists.yaml`, check merged findings against required categories per component type. Flag gaps as warnings, trigger targeted re-analysis for missing categories (single pass, no retry loop).

### Component 4: Risk Scorer Agent Enhancement

**File modified**: `.claude/agents/tachi/risk-scorer.md`
**Type**: Extended existing agent with delta-aware scoring
**Purpose**: Support score inheritance for stable findings and bounded scoring for new findings.

Delta-aware scoring rules:
- **UNCHANGED**: Inherit all scores (composite, CVSS vector, governance fields) verbatim from baseline. `score_source: inherited`.
- **UPDATED**: Re-score fresh using full 4-dimensional model. `score_source: fresh`.
- **NEW**: Score fresh with CVSS base bounded within +/-1.0 of category defaults from `schemas/risk-scoring.yaml`. `score_source: fresh`.
- **RESOLVED**: Retain last-known scores for historical reference.

### Component 5: Control Analyzer Agent Enhancement

**File modified**: `.claude/agents/tachi/control-analyzer.md`
**Type**: Extended existing agent with incremental re-scan
**Purpose**: Support control status carry-forward for stable findings and incremental re-scanning for changed findings.

Carry-forward rules:
- **UNCHANGED**: Carry forward control_status, control_evidence, reduction_factor, and residual_score from baseline. `control_carry_forward: true`.
- **NEW/UPDATED**: Full re-scan against target codebase. `control_carry_forward: false`.
- **Incremental scope**: When `rescan_scope: incremental`, only NEW and UPDATED findings trigger codebase scanning.

### Component 6: Orchestration Skill Domain Knowledge

**Files modified**: `.claude/skills/tachi-orchestration/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/tachi-risk-scoring/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/tachi-control-analysis/SKILL.md`
**New file**: `.claude/skills/tachi-orchestration/references/baseline-correlation.md`
**Type**: Extended existing skills + new reference file
**Purpose**: Add baseline-aware domain knowledge to the three tachi methodology skills.

| Skill | Updates | New Reference |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `tachi-orchestration` | Baseline detection rules, finding registry format, coverage gate specification in SKILL.md | `references/baseline-correlation.md` -- file detection priority, finding registry extraction, fingerprint computation, matching algorithm with tie-breaking, delta classification rules, sequential ID assignment, baseline metadata extraction |
| `tachi-risk-scoring` | Score inheritance rules, bounded scoring specification, score_source field derivation | None (rules added to SKILL.md) |
| `tachi-control-analysis` | Carry-forward rules, incremental re-scan specification, rescan_scope derivation | None (rules added to SKILL.md) |

### Component 7: Output Template Updates

**Files modified**: All 6 output templates (3 markdown + 3 SARIF)
**Type**: Extended with baseline-aware sections and properties
**Purpose**: Surface delta annotations, score provenance, and control inheritance in pipeline outputs.

| Template | Baseline Extensions |
|----------|-------------------|
| `threats.md` | Baseline frontmatter block (source, date, finding_count), delta_status column in threat tables, RESOLVED findings section, coverage gate results section |
| `risk-scores.md` | score_source column (inherited/fresh), baseline reference in frontmatter |
| `compensating-controls.md` | control_carry_forward column, rescan_scope in frontmatter |
| `threats.sarif` | `baselineRunId` in partialFingerprints, `baselineState` property per result (new/unchanged/updated/absent) |
| `risk-scores.sarif` | `score_source` property per result |
| `compensating-controls.sarif` | `carry_forward` property per result |

### Feature 078: Agent Context Optimization

## Components

### Component 1: Agent Definitions (6 files restructured)

**Files**: `.claude/agents/tachi/{orchestrator,risk-scorer,control-analyzer,threat-report,threat-infographic,report-assembler}.md`
**Type**: Restructured existing files
**Purpose**: Convert 6 monolithic agent prompts to lean definitions containing only orchestration logic, with domain knowledge loaded on-demand from skill references.

Each restructured agent retains: role identity (2-3 lines), workflow skeleton (phases, decision points), skill loading instructions (navigation table + MANDATORY Read at branch points), output format summary, constraints and error handling. Domain-specific content (scoring tables, template specifications, detection patterns, formatting rules) moved to skill reference files.

| Agent | Before | After | Reduction | Skill Target |
|-------|--------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| orchestrator | 1,286 lines | ~500 lines | ~61% | tachi-orchestration |
| risk-scorer | 1,093 lines | ~500 lines | ~54% | tachi-risk-scoring |
| control-analyzer | 973 lines | ~500 lines | ~49% | tachi-control-analysis |
| threat-report | 800 lines | ~300 lines | ~63% | tachi-threat-reporting |
| threat-infographic | 775 lines | ~300 lines | ~61% | tachi-infographics |
| report-assembler | 654 lines | ~300 lines | ~54% | tachi-report-assembly |

### Component 2: Skill Reference Files (15 new + 6 enhanced)

**Directories**: `.claude/skills/tachi-*/references/`
**Type**: New reference files in 4 new skill directories + enhanced references in 2 existing skill directories
**Purpose**: Domain knowledge loaded on-demand via Read tool at specific pipeline phases, following the [On-Demand Reference File Segmentation](../03_patterns/README.md#pattern-on-demand-reference-file-segmentation) pattern.

New skill directories (Feature 078):
- `tachi-report-assembly/references/` -- 3 files: brand-asset-guidelines.md, typst-artifacts.md, typst-template-contract.md
- `tachi-threat-reporting/references/` -- 3 files: narrative-templates.md, attack-tree-construction.md, attack-tree-examples.md
- `tachi-infographics/references/` -- 4 files: infographic-specifications.md, template-specific-formats.md, gemini-prompt-construction.md, visual-design-system.md
- `tachi-shared/references/` -- 3 files: severity-bands-shared.md, stride-categories-shared.md, finding-format-shared.md

Enhanced existing skill directories (Feature 078):
- `tachi-orchestration/references/` -- 5 new files added: format-detection.md, dfd-classification.md, trust-boundaries.md, coverage-requirements.md, coverage-matrix-model.md
- `tachi-risk-scoring/references/` -- 3 new files added: output-formatting.md, reachability-analysis.md, trust-zones.md

### Component 3: Shared Definitions (tachi-shared)

**Directory**: `.claude/skills/tachi-shared/`
**Type**: New skill directory
**Purpose**: Single-source-of-truth reference files consumed by multiple agents, preventing cross-agent drift in severity thresholds, category definitions, and finding format specifications.

| Reference | Consumers | Content |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| `severity-bands-shared.md` | orchestrator, risk-scorer, control-analyzer | Severity band thresholds, SLA mapping, risk disposition rules |
| `stride-categories-shared.md` | orchestrator, all 6 STRIDE agents | STRIDE+AI category definitions (8 categories), DFD element applicability matrix |
| `finding-format-shared.md` | all 17 agents | Finding IR format specification, required/optional fields, validation rules |

### Component 4: Model Field Governance (17 agents)

**Files**: All `.claude/agents/tachi/*.md` YAML frontmatter
**Type**: Modified existing files (additive)
**Purpose**: Explicit `model: sonnet` field in YAML frontmatter of all 17 agent definitions, enabling intentional model-to-task matching, cost tracking, and reproducibility.

Applies to: 6 STRIDE agents, 5 AI agents, orchestrator, risk-scorer, control-analyzer, threat-report, threat-infographic, report-assembler.

### Component 5: Best Practices Document

**File**: `.claude/agents/tachi/_TACHI_AGENT_BEST_PRACTICES.md`
**Type**: New file
**Purpose**: Codified conventions for agent definition structure, skill reference organization, shared definition governance, and model field assignment. Serves as contributor guide for future agent authoring.

### Feature 066: Install Script and Version Tagging

## Components

### C1: Install Script (`scripts/install.sh`)

Bash 3.2+ script (~200 lines) that copies all distributable files from a tachi source directory to the target project. Auto-detects source from script location using `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` pattern (matching `generate-adapter-version.sh`). Supports `--source`, `--version`, and `--help` flags via manual `while/case` parsing.

Key mechanisms:
- Manifest parsing: extracts paths between `<!-- BEGIN MANIFEST -->` / `<!-- END MANIFEST -->` markers
- Version checkout: dirty tree check → record branch → trap EXIT → checkout tag → copy → restore
- File copy: `mkdir -p` + `cp -r` for each manifest path; additive only (never deletes)

### C2: Machine-Parseable Manifest Section

HTML comment-delimited section in `INSTALL_MANIFEST.md` with one distributable path per line. Directories end with `/`, individual files do not. Parsed by the install script instead of the human-readable markdown tables.

### C3: README Quick Start Update

Updated Step 2 with single install command as primary path. Manual `cp -r` commands preserved in collapsible `<details>` block.

### C4: Developer Guide Update

`docs/guides/DEVELOPER_GUIDE_TACHI.md` install section updated to match README.

### C5: Version Tagging

First annotated tag `v4.0.0` on main after PR merge. Enables `git describe --tags --always` for version reporting.

## Data Flow

```
User runs install.sh from target project root
  │
  ├─ 1. Auto-detect SOURCE_DIR from BASH_SOURCE (or --source override)
  ├─ 2. If --version: dirty tree check → record branch → trap EXIT → checkout tag
  ├─ 3. Parse INSTALL_MANIFEST.md (machine-parseable section)
  ├─ 4. For each path: mkdir -p + cp -r → target directory
  ├─ 5. Report: version, file count, source path
  └─ 6. If --version: trap restores original branch on EXIT
```

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Justification |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Script | Bash 3.2+ | macOS default, matches existing tachi scripts |
| File copy | `cp -r`, `mkdir -p` | Standard coreutils, no external deps |
| Version detection | `git describe --tags --always` | Version string from nearest tag |
| Dirty tree check | `git status --porcelain` | Machine-parseable, catches all change types |
| Branch restore | `trap cleanup EXIT` | Guaranteed execution on all exit paths |
| Manifest parsing | `sed`/`awk` between HTML comment markers | No external parser, Bash 3.2 compatible |

### Feature 086: Automated Release Tagging

## Components

### Component 1: GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`)

**Purpose**: Triggers release-please on every push to `main` branch.

**Configuration**:
- Trigger: `on: push: branches: [main]`
- Permissions: `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`
- Action: `googleapis/release-please-action@v4`
- Release type: `simple`

### Component 2: Release Configuration (`release-please-config.json`)

**Purpose**: Controls release-please behavior — release type, CHANGELOG grouping, versioning.

### Component 3: Version Manifest (`.release-please-manifest.json`)

**Purpose**: Tracks current released version. Initial value: `{"." : "4.0.0"}`.

## Data Flow

              │
              └─ Maintainer merges Release PR
                   │
                   ▼
              release-please creates:
              1. Git tag (e.g., v4.1.0)
              2. GitHub Release with notes
              3. Updates CHANGELOG.md
              4. Updates .release-please-manifest.json
```

## Tech Stack

|-------|-----------|---------------|
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Already the platform; zero additional infrastructure |
| Release Automation | release-please v4 | Industry standard (40k+ stars), maintained by Google |
| Configuration | JSON | release-please's native config format |
| Versioning | Semantic Versioning | Matches existing v4.0.0 convention |

### Feature 104: Downstream Baseline Propagation

**Status**: Delivered (2026-04-08) | PR #107 | 18/18 tasks complete

## Components

### Component 1: Shared Parser Extensions

**File modified**: `scripts/tachi_parsers.py`
**Type**: Extended existing module with 3 new/updated functions
**Purpose**: Provide shared baseline metadata and delta lifecycle extraction for all downstream consumers (report and infographic extraction scripts).

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `parse_baseline_frontmatter()` | Extract baseline metadata (source, date, finding_count, run_id) from nested YAML frontmatter block in threats.md. Handles both standard and code-fenced frontmatter delimiters. Returns None values when no baseline is present. |
| `parse_resolved_findings()` | Parse Section 4b Resolved Findings table. Returns list of resolved finding dicts with `delta_status: "RESOLVED"` injected. Returns empty list when Section 4b is absent (first run, no baseline). |
| `parse_threats_findings()` (updated) | Extended to extract optional `delta_status` field from Status column in Section 7 Recommended Actions table. Backward compatible -- omits field when Status column is absent. |

### Component 2: Output Schema Updates

**Files modified**: `templates/tachi/output-schemas/threats.md`, `templates/tachi/output-schemas/threat-report.md`
**Type**: Extended existing output schemas
**Purpose**: Surface baseline lifecycle data in standardized output formats for downstream consumption.

| Template | Changes |
|----------|---------|
| `threats.md` | Section 7 Recommended Actions gains Status column carrying `delta_status` (NEW/UNCHANGED/UPDATED); new Section 8 Delta Summary with finding lifecycle counts, remediation proof, and baseline reference table |
| `threat-report.md` | Schema version bumped 1.0 to 1.1; frontmatter gains `baseline_source`, `baseline_date`, `delta_counts` (new/unchanged/updated/resolved) fields; new Section 8 Delta Summary |

### Component 3: Threat Report Agent Enhancement

**File modified**: `agents/threat-report.md`
**Type**: Extended existing agent with delta-aware narrative generation
**Purpose**: Adapt executive summary, threat analysis, and remediation roadmap narratives to highlight changes since baseline.

Delta-aware narrative rules:
- Executive summary includes baseline comparison paragraph when baseline data is present
- Threat analysis sections annotate individual findings with lifecycle status
- New Section 8 Delta Summary generated with lifecycle breakdown and baseline reference
- Attack tree generation scoped to NEW and UPDATED Critical/High findings (UNCHANGED findings carried from baseline)
- Frontmatter populated with baseline metadata and delta counts from source threats.md

### Component 4: Extraction Script Updates

**Files modified**: `scripts/extract-report-data.py`, `scripts/extract-infographic-data.py`
**Type**: Extended existing extraction scripts with baseline data support
**Purpose**: Propagate baseline metadata and delta lifecycle counts to Typst and JSON data formats for report and infographic rendering.

| Script | Changes |
|--------|---------|
| `extract-report-data.py` | Emits baseline metadata Typst variables (source, date, finding count, run ID), delta lifecycle count variables, and `has-baseline-data` boolean flag for conditional report section inclusion |
| `extract-infographic-data.py` | Emits baseline metadata and delta lifecycle fields in JSON output when baseline data is present in source artifacts |

### Component 5: Command Updates

**Files modified**: `.claude/commands/tachi.infographic.md`, `.claude/commands/tachi.security-report.md`
**Type**: Extended existing commands with baseline data display
**Purpose**: Surface baseline comparison data in infographic specifications and PDF security reports.

| Command | Changes |
|---------|---------|
| `/tachi.infographic` | Baseline metadata passed to infographic templates for delta annotation display |
| `/tachi.security-report` | Baseline data variables available for conditional page inclusion in Typst report |

### Component 6: Report Assembler Agent Enhancement

**File modified**: `.claude/agents/tachi/report-assembler.md`
**Type**: Extended existing agent with baseline data assembly
**Purpose**: Include baseline metadata and delta lifecycle data in PDF security report assembly.

### Component 7: Example Output Regeneration

**Files modified**: All 6 example `threats.md` files, 2 example `threat-report.md` files
**Type**: Regenerated with baseline columns
**Purpose**: Reference implementations updated to demonstrate Section 7 Status column and Section 8 Delta Summary format.

### Feature 112: Attack Path Pages in Security Report PDF

**Status**: Delivered (2026-04-09) | PR #115 | 18/18 tasks complete

## Components

### Component 1: Attack Tree Data Extraction

**File modified**: `scripts/extract-report-data.py`
**Type**: Extended existing script with 2 new functions
**Purpose**: Parse attack tree Mermaid files, render to PNG via `mmdc` subprocess, and emit structured data for Typst page rendering.

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `parse_attack_trees()` | Scans `attack-trees/` directory for `*-attack-tree.md` files, extracts finding ID, component, severity from metadata table, extracts Mermaid code block, cross-references finding ID with parsed findings data for authoritative severity and mitigation text, filters to Critical and High findings, orders by severity then finding ID. Constructs narrative from attack tree metadata and node labels, sources remediation from finding mitigation field. |
| `render_mermaid_to_png()` | Checks `mmdc` availability via `shutil.which()`, creates `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` for intermediate files, invokes `mmdc -i {id}.mmd -o {id}.png -s 2 -b transparent` per entry, copies PNGs to `attack-trees/` directory for Typst consumption. Graceful fallback: sets `has_image = false` per entry when `mmdc` unavailable or rendering fails; raw Mermaid text displayed instead. |

**Output to `report-data.typ`**: `has-attack-trees` (boolean), `attack-trees` (array of dicts with: id, component, severity, title, image-path, has-image, mermaid-text, narrative, remediation).

### Component 2: Artifact Detection Extension

**File modified**: `scripts/tachi_parsers.py`
**Type**: Extended existing function
**Purpose**: Add `attack-trees/` directory detection to the canonical `detect_artifacts()` entry point, returning `has_attack_trees` boolean and directory path.

### Component 3: Attack Path Typst Page Template

**New file**: `templates/tachi/security-report/attack-path.typ`
**Type**: New file
**Purpose**: Renders one portrait page per attack path entry with severity badge, rendered diagram (or raw Mermaid fallback), narrative explanation, and remediation steps.

Exports `attack-path-page(entry, classification)` function rendering:
- Header with classification bar via `report-header()`
- Severity-colored finding badge (using `severity-color()`) with finding ID and title
- Diagram section (~60% page height): `#image()` if `has-image` is true, `#raw()` monospace block otherwise
- Narrative section: 2-4 sentence attack chain explanation
- Remediation section: Bulleted list of remediation steps
- Standard footer via `report-footer()`

Follows patterns from `maestro-findings.typ`: imports `shared.typ`, exports single function, severity badge helper.

### Component 4: Main Orchestrator Update

**File modified**: `templates/tachi/security-report/main.typ`
**Type**: Modified
**Purpose**: Import `attack-path.typ`, add backward-compatible defaults for `has-attack-trees` and `attack-trees` variables, insert conditional attack path page section after Executive Summary (before infographic pages).

Conditional inclusion:
```typst
#if has-attack-trees and attack-trees.len() > 0 {
  section-divider("Attack Path Analysis", classification: classification)
  for entry in attack-trees {
    page(...)[#attack-path-page(entry: entry, classification: classification)]
  }
}
```

### Component 5: Command and Agent Updates

**Files modified**: `.claude/commands/tachi.security-report.md`, `.claude/agents/tachi/report-assembler.md`
**Type**: Extended existing files
**Purpose**: Add `attack-trees/` directory to artifact detection tables and attack path pages to page listing display.

### Component 6: Example Output Validation

**Files validated**: All 6 example `sample-report/` directories
**Type**: End-to-end pipeline validation
**Purpose**: 2 examples with attack trees (attack path pages rendered), 4 examples without (backward compatible, no attack path pages).

## Data Flow

```
attack-trees/*.md ──┐
                     ├──> extract-report-data.py ──> mmdc (PNG) ──> report-data.typ ──> main.typ ──> PDF
threat-report.md ───┘                                                                    |
                                                                              attack-path.typ
```

1. **Input**: `attack-trees/{id}-attack-tree.md` files (primary) or `threat-report.md` Section 5 (fallback)
2. **Extraction**: `parse_attack_trees()` reads metadata tables + Mermaid code blocks
3. **Rendering**: `render_mermaid_to_png()` converts Mermaid to PNG via `mmdc` subprocess (optional, graceful fallback)
4. **Data binding**: Attack tree entries written to `report-data.typ` as Typst array with `has-attack-trees` boolean gate
5. **Template**: `attack-path.typ` renders each entry as a portrait page with severity badge, diagram, narrative, remediation
6. **Orchestration**: `main.typ` conditionally includes section divider + pages after Executive Summary

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose | Justification |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Python 3.9+ (stdlib only) | Attack tree parsing and data extraction | Extends existing `extract-report-data.py` pattern; `shutil.which()` and `subprocess` for mmdc invocation |
| `mmdc` (Mermaid CLI, optional) | Mermaid-to-PNG rendering for diagram embedding | Standard tool for Mermaid rendering; graceful fallback to raw text when unavailable |
| Typst | Attack path page template | Extends existing PDF report template system via hub-first architecture |
| PNG @ 2x scale | Rendered diagram images | Consistent with existing infographic image handling in Typst report |

### Feature 121: Rename Tachi Commands to tachi.* Namespace

## Components

### Component 1: Command File Renames

**Purpose**: Rename the 5 primary command files and create 1 new command
**Files**: `.claude/commands/`

| Current File | New File | Action |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| `threat-model.md` | `tachi.threat-model.md` | Rename (git mv) |

### Component 3: Cross-Reference Updates

~344 files, ~2,207 references. Three-tier pattern strategy: Tier 1 (slash invocations), Tier 2 (path-qualified file refs), Tier 3 (manual review for bare filenames).

### Component 4: Install Script Cleanup

Deprecated-file removal in `scripts/install.sh` before manifest copy loop. Removes 5 old unprefixed command files from consumer projects on upgrade.

### Component 5: Manifest Update

`INSTALL_MANIFEST.md` updated with 6 `tachi.*` command filenames in both human-readable and machine-parseable sections.

## Data Flow

```
User invokes /tachi.threat-model → threats.md
User invokes /tachi.risk-score → risk-scores.md
User invokes /tachi.compensating-controls → compensating-controls.md
User invokes /tachi.infographic → infographic images
User invokes /tachi.security-report → PDF security report
User invokes /tachi.architecture → architecture.md (pipeline input)
```

Data flow unchanged — only command invocation names change from unprefixed to `tachi.*` prefixed.

### Feature 128: Executive Threat Architecture Infographic

## Components

The feature touches the following logical components of the tachi pipeline:

### Extraction Layer
- **`extract-infographic-data.py`**: Receives `--template executive-architecture`; reads threats.md (with optional risk-scores or compensating-controls for tier upgrade); parses scope data via shared `tachi_parsers.parse_scope_data()`; groups components into architectural layers via existing `_compute_trust_zones()`; filters findings to Critical/High; selects one callout per layer (severity desc → composite score desc → finding ID asc); outputs JSON payload to stdout.
- **`extract-report-data.py`**: Adds new entry in `detect_images()` for `threat-executive-architecture.jpg`; writes `has-executive-architecture` boolean and `executive-architecture-image-path` string into the generated `report-data.typ` file.

### Spec Generation Layer
- **`tachi-threat-infographic` agent (`.claude/agents/tachi/threat-infographic.md`)**: Receives the JSON payload from extraction; renders the six-section markdown spec; constructs the Gemini prompt with portrait orientation, layer ordering, pastel fills, red dashed-border callouts, warning icons, and ≤25-word plain-English narrative instructions.

### Image Generation Layer
- **Existing Gemini integration**: Reused as-is. The agent invokes Gemini with the constructed prompt; on success writes `threat-executive-architecture.jpg` to the output folder; on failure leaves the spec file in place (spec-first per ADR-014).

### PDF Assembly Layer
- **`main.typ`**: Imports `report-data.typ`; conditionally renders the executive architecture page using existing `infographic-page()` (already portrait), gated by `has-executive-architecture`, positioned immediately after Executive Summary and immediately before Attack Path Analysis.
- **`report-assembler` agent**: Documentation update only — adds the new artifact to its detection table.

### Schema and Command Layer
- **`schemas/infographic.yaml`**: Adds `executive-architecture` to the template enumeration with section structure and visual directive constants.
- **`.claude/commands/tachi.infographic.md`**: Adds new template to argparse choices, adds `exec` alias, includes in `all` expansion before MAESTRO additions.
- **`.claude/skills/tachi-infographics/references/`**: New reference doc describing the template, its outputs, and expected behavior.

### Feature 136: MAESTRO Canonical Layer Correctness Fix

**Status**: Delivered (2026-04-10) | PR #146 (squash commit 31356fb) | Release v4.10.0

## Components

No new components. This is a data/template refresh feature operating on existing MAESTRO taxonomy infrastructure introduced in Feature 084 and Feature 091. The pipeline is fully data-driven — scripts/extract-*.py have no hardcoded layer name matching, so the fix is pure content replacement across foundation files, templates, and example outputs.

### Component 1: MAESTRO Shared Reference File — Canonical Rename
**File**: `.claude/skills/tachi-shared/references/maestro-layers-shared.md`
**Type**: Modification
**Purpose**: Rename L5/L6/L7 to canonical CSA MAESTRO layer names per the Ken Huang authoritative definition — L5 "Security" → "Evaluation and Observability", L6 "Agent Ecosystem" → "Security and Compliance", L7 "User Interface" → "Agent Ecosystem". Correct the MAESTRO acronym expansion to "Multi-Agent Environment, Security, Threat, Risk, and Outcome". Reassign keyword tables accordingly (add new L5 observability keywords, move legacy L5 security keywords to L6, merge legacy L6/L7 into new L7). Add verbatim Ordering Rationale section explaining L5-before-L6 specificity gradient (load-bearing for detective-vs-preventive control classification).

### Component 2: Finding IR Schema Enum Update
**File**: `schemas/finding.yaml`
**Type**: Modification
**Purpose**: Update `maestro_layer` enum to canonical L5/L6/L7 names. Bump `schema_version` from "1.2" to "1.3" to signal the breaking enum-value change. Establishes the **enum-value-only minor-bump rule**: enum-value-only breaking changes to `schemas/finding.yaml` warrant a minor schema bump (x.y+1), not a major bump, provided the schema shape and required fields are unchanged. Rule documented in ADR-020 Revision History.

### Component 3: Typst Security Report Template — Layer Prose and Fallback Dictionary
**File**: `templates/tachi/security-report/maestro-findings.typ`
**Type**: Modification
**Purpose**: Update MAESTRO Findings page layer prose (line 121 "User Interface (L7)" → "Agent Ecosystem (L7)") and fix pre-existing third-way divergence bug in the fallback dictionary (lines 132-134) where "Integration Services" had crept in as neither the old Feature 084 name nor the canonical CSA name. Fallback dict now matches canonical CSA names exactly.

### Component 4: Typst Full-Bleed Infographic Layout Fix
**File**: `templates/tachi/security-report/full-bleed.typ`
**Type**: Modification
**Purpose**: Constrain image height in `infographic-page()` function to 7.5in with `fit: "contain"` to handle portrait-aspect infographics that would otherwise overflow the page. Fixes a **latent Feature 128 bug** that surfaced when the executive-architecture portrait JPEG was added without height constraint. Scope expansion inside the Feature 136 PR; not a planned deliverable.

### Component 5: ADR-020 Revision History
**File**: `docs/architecture/02_ADRs/ADR-020-maestro-layer-classification.md`
**Type**: Modification
**Purpose**: Add Revision History section documenting the Feature 136 canonical rename and establishing the enum-value-only minor-bump schema versioning rule as an enduring precedent for future enum corrections. References `schemas/finding.yaml` v1.3.

### Component 6: Additional Foundation Files
**Files**: `.claude/skills/tachi-shared/references/finding-format-shared.md`, `.claude/skills/tachi-orchestration/references/dispatch-rules.md`, `.claude/skills/tachi-orchestration/references/output-schemas.md`, `docs/architecture/00_Tech_Stack/README.md`, `templates/tachi/output-schemas/threats.md`, `templates/tachi/infographics/infographic-maestro-stack.md`, `templates/tachi/infographics/infographic-maestro-heatmap.md`, `templates/tachi/security-report/main.typ`, `README.md`, `docs/product/02_PRD/INDEX.md`, `docs/product/_backlog/BACKLOG.md`, `schemas/finding.yaml` — 14 foundation files updated total
**Type**: Modifications
**Purpose**: Propagate canonical layer names across all pipeline documentation, output schemas, infographic templates, and product-facing indices. No runtime pipeline changes required — all updates are content replacement in docs, templates, and references.

### Component 7: Example Output Regeneration
**Files**: `examples/{web-app,microservices,agentic-app,ascii-web-api,mermaid-agentic-app,free-text-microservice}/**` — 6 example architectures regenerated
**Type**: Regeneration
**Purpose**: Regenerate all 6 example threat models and downstream outputs with canonical layer names. 5 example PDFs regenerated byte-deterministically via `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000` (per ADR-021) for backward-compatibility baseline validation. 1 example (agentic-app) intentionally excluded from byte-determinism test per Feature 128 convention.

### Component 8: Golden Test Fixtures
**Files**: `tests/scripts/fixtures/golden/maestro-heatmap.json`, `tests/scripts/fixtures/golden/maestro-stack.json`
**Type**: Frozen (no regeneration required)
**Purpose**: Confirmed that both MAESTRO golden fixtures are frozen pre-MAESTRO schema — they do NOT contain layer name references. No regeneration needed; existing fixtures remain valid.

**Data flow change**: None structurally. The same pipeline carries new canonical layer name strings from the shared reference through to the PDF output. The only runtime-active change is the `maestro-findings.typ` fallback dictionary — a safety net for when `layer-name` data is missing in `report-data.typ` (should never happen in the normal flow but now matches canonical names if invoked).

## Tech Stack

No stack changes. Reuses existing infrastructure:

| Layer | Technology | Version | Role in F-136 |
|-------|------------|---------|---------------|
| Taxonomy reference | Markdown | n/a | Content update in `.claude/skills/tachi-shared/references/maestro-layers-shared.md` |
| Schema | YAML | 1.3 | Enum value rename + schema_version bump in `schemas/finding.yaml` |
| PDF templates | Typst | 0.11+ | Content update in `maestro-findings.typ`, `main.typ`; layout fix in `full-bleed.typ` |
| Infographic templates | Markdown | n/a | Content update in `infographic-maestro-stack.md`, `infographic-maestro-heatmap.md` |
| Byte-determinism | `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000` | Feature 128 convention | Baseline PDF regeneration (per ADR-021) |
| Testing | pytest + test_backward_compatibility.py | existing | 150+ tests pass post-regeneration; golden fixtures frozen |
| Release | release-please | v4.10.0 | Minor bump auto-cut by release-please workflow on merge to main |

**No new dependencies introduced.**

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Enum-value-only minor-bump rule** (new, established for this feature): Enum-value-only breaking changes to `schemas/finding.yaml` warrant a minor schema bump (x.y+1), not a major bump, provided the schema shape and required fields are unchanged. The CHANGELOG migration note is the accountability mechanism for downstream consumers. This rule is documented in ADR-020 Revision History and applies to future enum-value corrections.

2. **Canonical CSA MAESTRO authoritative source**: Ken Huang's published CSA definition is the single source of truth for MAESTRO layer names, keywords, and taxonomy ordering. Any future divergence must be explicitly justified in ADR-020 with linked source references.

3. **Pipeline is data-driven** (pre-existing, validated): The fix required zero Python script changes. `scripts/extract-*.py` have no hardcoded layer name matching — they read layer values from source artifact frontmatter/tables. This confirmed ADR-017's determinism claim and the Feature 084 "passive propagation" design.

## Known Deferred Items

Follow-up issues recommended (not blocking Feature 136 closure):

1. **Agentic-app sample-report JPEG regeneration**: Three infographic JPEGs in `examples/agentic-app/sample-report/` need re-rendering via Gemini API. Deferred because Gemini API calls are non-deterministic and cannot be gated by `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`. Manual regeneration planned in a follow-up housekeeping PR.

2. **Infographic extract tier-selection bug**: When source is `compensating-controls.md`, the extraction script's tier-detection logic has a subtle misclassification bug (observed during Feature 136 validation, not in scope for correctness fix). Planned as a follow-up bug fix issue.

### Feature 130: Fix Attack Path Mermaid Rendering When mmdc Is Not Installed

## Components

### Preflight Gate (shell-level)
- **Location**: `.claude/commands/tachi.security-report.md` Step 1
- **Role**: First-line enforcement of mmdc availability at command entry, gated on attack-tree detection
- **Pattern**: mirrors the existing Typst `which typst` check in the same file
- **Failure mode**: non-zero exit with canonical error message

### Preflight Gate (Python-level)
- **Location**: `scripts/extract-report-data.py::render_mermaid_to_png()` line 725
- **Role**: Defense-in-depth for direct Python invocations (tests, tooling)
- **Pattern**: existing `shutil.which("mmdc")` check, converted from silent `return` to `raise RuntimeError(...)`
- **Failure mode**: exception propagates up and exits the pipeline non-zero

### Mid-Render Failure Aggregator (new behavior)
- **Location**: `scripts/extract-report-data.py::render_mermaid_to_png()` after the `as_completed` loop
- **Role**: Collects per-finding rendering failures into a list, then raises `RuntimeError("Attack path rendering failed for N findings: [...]")` if the list is non-empty
- **Failure mode**: exception propagates, pipeline exits non-zero, stderr shows per-finding detail

### CI Workflow
- **Location**: `.github/workflows/tachi-mmdc-preflight.yml` (new file)
- **Trigger**: `pull_request` on 5 file paths listed in FR-130.7
- **Role**: CI-level enforcement that the loud-failure path works on a machine without mmdc
- **Platform**: `ubuntu-latest` (no custom Docker image)

### Docs Sync Cluster
- `README.md` Prerequisites section (new)
- `scripts/install.sh` mmdc check (new code block)
- `docs/architecture/00_Tech_Stack/README.md` line 279 (update mmdc from optional to hard prereq)
- `specs/112-attack-path-pages/spec.md` SC-004 inversion, line 135 deletion
- `specs/112-attack-path-pages/research.md` line 80 correction, lines 91-93 rationale block
- `docs/architecture/02_ADRs/ADR-022-mmdc-hard-prerequisite.md` (new — first ADR governing CLI prerequisite transitions)

### Feature 082: threat-agent-skill

## Components

### C1: Threat Agent File (11 instances)

- **Responsibility**: Orchestration-only markdown file invoked by orchestrator dispatch. Loads domain knowledge on-demand from companion skill directory; constructs findings in the shared format; emits findings to orchestrator.
- **Interface**: Input — component name + DFD element type from orchestrator. Output — finding list in `schemas/finding.yaml` v1.3 format.
- **Dependencies**: (a) Companion skill directory `tachi-<agent-name>/references/`; (b) shared skill directory `tachi-shared/references/` for finding format and severity bands; (c) orchestrator for invocation and finding aggregation.
- **Line target**: STRIDE ≤120, AI ≤150, hard ceiling 180.
- **Location**: `.claude/agents/tachi/<agent-name>.md`

### C2: Companion Skill Directory (11 instances)

- **Responsibility**: Per-agent domain knowledge store. Holds detection patterns, optional example findings, optional finding field guidance. Loaded on-demand by the parent agent file via `**MANDATORY**: Read` directive.
- **Interface**: File-system directory readable by the Claude Code `Read` tool. Reference files are markdown.
- **Dependencies**: Parent threat agent file reads from this directory; no other agent reads from it.
- **Line target**: 60-300 lines per reference file, typically 100-200. Total per directory: 150-500 lines.
- **Location**: `.claude/skills/tachi-<agent-name>/references/`

### C3: Shared Skill Directory (1 instance, already exists)

- **Responsibility**: Cross-agent shared content. Severity bands, finding format, STRIDE category definitions, MAESTRO layer taxonomy. Consumed by multiple agents — infrastructure tier (6 agents) already consumes it; threat tier (11 agents) starts consuming it in Phase 2c.
- **Interface**: File-system directory, markdown reference files. Consumed via `**MANDATORY**: Read` directives across the agent fleet.
- **Dependencies**: Read-only from any individual agent's perspective. Edits go through Phase 2c single-writer wave and are additive-only.
- **Blast radius**: Any edit to a shared reference file can affect all 17 agents (threat + infra). Re-baseline of 5 byte-deterministic PDFs is the expected outcome of any edit (FR-17 / R6).
- **Location**: `.claude/skills/tachi-shared/references/` (existing: 4 files, 646 lines)

### C4: Orchestrator Dispatch (unchanged)

- **Responsibility**: Phase 1 component inventory; Phase 2 dispatch to threat agents; Phase 3 Table Assembly (including MAESTRO layer inheritance for each finding). Orchestrator is the only tachi agent that knows about MAESTRO; it remains so after this refactor (FR-9).
- **Interface**: Calls each threat agent with component + DFD element type; receives finding list; merges findings into master `threats.md`.
- **Dependencies**: Reads its own skill directory `tachi-orchestration/references/` (dispatch rules, classification rules, MAESTRO-layers-shared).
- **Impact of Feature 082**: Zero. Orchestrator dispatch logic and interface are unchanged (C2). The refactor is transparent to orchestrator.
- **Location**: `.claude/agents/tachi/orchestrator.md` (not touched by this feature)

### C5: ADR-023 (new architectural decision record)

- **Responsibility**: Document the detection sibling variant of the lean + skill references pattern. Record decisions on load-point semantics, MAESTRO boundary, additive-only shared-ref edits, and consumer/producer audience separation in shared files.
- **Interface**: Read by future contributors adding new threat detection patterns. Referenced from `docs/architecture/00_Tech_Stack/README.md` agent inventory section.
- **Location**: `docs/architecture/02_ADRs/ADR-023-threat-agent-skill-references-pattern.md` (NEW, created in Phase 1)

                    └──▶ Write threats.md
```

**Key observation**: The input (user command) and output (`threats.md`) are content-equivalent pre/post. The only change is the internal shape of each threat agent — where its detection vocabulary lives. Content-level regression on 6 example architectures is sufficient to validate the refactor; the orchestrator doesn't need any changes.

## Tech Stack

- **Agent runtime**: Claude Code (Anthropic) via the `.claude/agents/tachi/` markdown convention. No code, no framework, no language choice — agent files are configuration consumed by the Claude Code harness at invocation time.
- **Skill loading**: On-demand `Read` tool invocation from within agent files via `**MANDATORY**: Read <path>` directives. File-system reads only; no network, no daemon, no index.
- **Output format**: Finding list serialized to markdown (`threats.md`) and SARIF 2.1.0 (`threats.sarif`) by the orchestrator. Schema governed by `schemas/finding.yaml` v1.3 (unchanged by this feature).
- **Pipeline scripts**: `scripts/tachi_parsers.py`, `scripts/extract-*.py` — Python 3.11+ stdlib-only (PRD 128 convention). Unchanged by this feature.
- **PDF generation**: Typst + `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` (ADR-022 hard prerequisites). Unchanged by this feature, but 5 PDFs are re-baselined in Phase 3 (FR-17).
- **Byte-determinism**: `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000` environment variable per ADR-021. Applied to 5 non-agentic example PDF regenerations.
- **CI**: GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/tachi.threat-model.yml` runs example regeneration smoke tests. Unchanged by this feature.
- **Release management**: release-please (Feature 086) auto-cuts a version tag on merge to main.
- **Primary source citations** (referenced only, never runtime-fetched): OWASP Top 10 (CC BY 3.0), OWASP LLM Top 10 v2025 (CC BY-SA 4.0), OWASP AI Exchange (CC0), MITRE ATT&CK v15+ (free w/ attribution), MITRE ATLAS v5.1+ (free w/ attribution), CWE Top 25 2024 (royalty-free), NIST AI 600-1 (US Federal public domain).

**No new technology introduced.** The refactor modifies markdown configuration and creates one new ADR. No new runtime dependencies, no new test frameworks, no schema changes.

### Feature 143: MAESTRO Phase 4 — OWASP AIVSS Evaluation ADR

## Components

This feature touches three surfaces; the canonical extraction for downstream system-design reference is listed below.

| Component | Type | File Path | Change Type | Rationale |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| ADR-024: OWASP AIVSS Evaluation and Tachi Composite Scoring Posture | New architecture decision record | `docs/architecture/02_ADRs/ADR-024-owasp-aivss-evaluation.md` | Create | PRD FR-5, Spec FR-005 — the primary deliverable |
| tachi-risk-scoring skill: AIVSS Relationship section | Update to existing skill file | `.claude/skills/tachi-risk-scoring/SKILL.md` | Add new section | PRD FR-6, Spec FR-006 — cross-reference to ADR-024 for skill consumers |
| Follow-on implementation Issue (conditional) | New GitHub Issue | `github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/issues` | Create (only if decision = Option A or B) | PRD FR-7, Spec FR-007 — deferred adoption work with option-specific effort estimate copied verbatim from ADR-024 |

**Architectural posture**: additive-only. No existing agent, schema, script, or example file is modified. ADR-024 becomes the canonical source of truth for tachi's AIVSS stance; SKILL.md becomes the runtime-adjacent pointer; the conditional Issue becomes the discovery anchor for any future implementation work.

## Data Flow

**No runtime data flow changes.** The feature is purely authoritative-document work.

### Author-time flow (implementer's workflow)

```
Wave 1 (Research):
  web-researcher → aivss.owasp.org (read v0.8 spec end-to-end, 2-hour timebox)
                → captures: version, URL, dimensions, formula, bands (if any)
                → produces: internal notes for Wave 2 consumption

Wave 2 (Authorship):
  architect → synthesizes Wave 1 notes with schemas/risk-scoring.yaml + severity-bands-shared.md
           → writes: ADR-024 (Context with 3 surfaces, Decision, Rationale, Alternatives, Consequences)
           → writes: SKILL.md AIVSS Relationship section (80-200 words, relative link to ADR-024)
  product-manager → IF decision is Option A or B:
                    uses .aod/scripts/bash/create-issue.sh
                    creates Issue with stage:discover label, option-specific effort verbatim
                  → ELSE (Option C):
                    no Issue filed (correct behavior per FR-007 conditionality)
```

### Read-time flow (stakeholder's workflow — post-merge)

```
CISO / compliance officer / future maintainer / security engineer
  → opens ADR-024 → reads Decision → follows cross-reference to SKILL.md (or vice versa)
  → sees consistent decision across both surfaces (FR-006 single-source-of-truth rule)
```

### Verification flow (gate at PR review)

```
PR review → SC-001 file exists → SC-002 Status: Accepted grep → SC-003 three surfaces present
         → SC-004 ≥3 options with effort estimate → SC-005 SKILL.md section present + word count
         → SC-006 git diff returns empty for schemas/scripts/agents/examples
         → SC-007 decision-noun consistency between ADR and SKILL.md
         → SC-008 conditional Issue filed (only if A or B) → SC-009 Related ADRs list includes ADR-020, -019, -018
```

## Tech Stack

### New Dependencies

**None.** This feature introduces zero new runtime or development dependencies.

### Tools Used (all pre-existing)

| Tool | Purpose | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
| Markdown | ADR-024 + SKILL.md authorship | Native to repository |
| YAML | ADR-024 frontmatter | Matches existing ADR-020 through ADR-023 convention |
| `.aod/scripts/bash/create-issue.sh` | Conditional follow-on Issue filing (Wave 2) | Pre-existing at `.aod/scripts/bash/create-issue.sh` |
| `bash` + `grep` + `git diff` | Verification gates (SC-002, SC-005, SC-006, SC-007) | Standard shell |
| Existing backward-compat test suite | Trivial pass gate | `tests/scripts/test_backward_compatibility.py` |

**No new technology introduced.** Documentation-only feature. Zero schema changes, zero script changes, zero agent changes, zero example regenerations.

### Feature 144: NIST AI RMF Integration Evaluation ADR

## Components

This feature does not add or modify runtime components. Components touched are documentation surfaces:

### Component 1 — ADR-025 (new)

**File**: `docs/architecture/02_ADRs/ADR-025-nist-ai-rmf-evaluation.md`
**Owner**: architect (Wave 2 author)

Sections: Header (Status: Accepted, Date, Deciders, Feature 144, Related ADRs cross-referencing ADR-024 + ADR-020 + ADR-019 + ADR-018 + ADR-021 + ADR-023); Context with three Surface subsections using explicit anchors `<a id="surface-{a,b,c}"></a>`; Decision (canonical noun in first paragraph); Rationale (five-criteria justification); Alternatives Considered (Options A/B/C); Consequences (Positive/Negative/Mitigation/Follow-on); When to Re-Evaluate; References. Length expected 200-280 lines.

## Data Flow

Documentation flows from authoring (Wave 1 + Wave 2) to publication (PR merge to `main`):

```
Wave 1 (3-hour timebox)
  web-researcher reads NIST AI RMF 1.0 + NIST AI 600-1 (canonical URLs from spec Assumptions)
  → appends findings to specs/144-*/research.md ## Wave 1 — NIST AI RMF Spec Notes section
  → escalates to PM if 3-hour budget exceeded (3 contingency options per Edge Case 1)

Wave 2 (sequential authorship)
  architect drafts ADR-025 skeleton
  → fills Surface A/B/C tables from research.md Wave 1 notes + tachi compensating controls reference
  → drafts Decision (canonical noun) → Rationale → Alternatives → Consequences → Re-Evaluation Triggers → References
  → creates .claude/skills/tachi-shared/references/nist-ai-rmf-mapping.md (content shape per chosen option)
  → appends ## NIST AI RMF Relationship section to .claude/skills/tachi-control-analysis/SKILL.md
  → appends ADR-025 back-reference to docs/architecture/02_ADRs/ADR-024-owasp-aivss-evaluation.md Related ADRs line
  → product-manager files follow-on Issue if Option B/C chosen (FR-008)

PR Cycle (~half-day)
  Open PR with docs: prefix conventional commit
  → 13 SCs verified (shell + awk + grep + pytest + manual inspection)
  → architect reviews PR (= "Accepted at merge" attestation per Closed Q2)
  → squash-merge to main
```

## Tech Stack

No tech stack changes. Reference lineage unchanged from current state:

- **Documentation format**: Markdown (CommonMark, no GFM extensions required)
- **ADR conventions**: Match ADR-022/023/024 structural template
- **Verifiers**: shell (`grep`, `awk`, `wc -w`, `tr`), Python (`pytest tests/scripts/test_backward_compatibility.py`), git (`git diff`, `git log`)
- **Determinism baseline**: `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000` for byte-identical PDF comparison (per ADR-021)
- **Conventional commits**: `docs:` prefix only (per Constitution IX + SC-012)
- **GitHub CLI**: `bash .aod/scripts/bash/create-issue.sh` for FR-008 conditional Issue filing

**Zero new runtime dependencies**: empty diff on `requirements*.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`. Zero new CLI prerequisites.

### Feature 142: MAESTRO Phase 3 — Agentic Threat Pattern Expansion

## Components

### Component 1: Pattern Synthesis Engine (Orchestrator Phase 3.6)

**Location**: `.claude/agents/tachi/orchestrator.md` (Phase 3.6 insertion **after** Feature 141's Phase 3.5 cross-layer correlation, **before** Phase 4 assessment)

**Responsibility**: After Phase 3.5 cross-layer chain correlation completes, synthesize the `agentic_pattern` value for each deduplicated finding using a deterministic rule-based classification engine. The engine MAY also generate net-new findings for the three previously-uncovered patterns (Agent Collusion, Emergent Behavior, Temporal Attack) when the architecture meets the multi-agent gate predicate AND the rule table indicates a pattern that no existing finding represents.

**Independence Invariants**:
- vs. Feature 141 Phase 3.5: Pattern synthesis runs AFTER cross-layer chain correlation; chains and patterns are independent grouping mechanisms
- vs. Section 4a intra-component correlation: Pattern field is finding-level metadata; Section 4a is a presentation-time grouping mechanism — orthogonal
- vs. existing 11 agents: Phase 3.6 reads the deduplicated finding IR but does NOT invoke or modify any threat-detection agent — zero-edit invariant

**Architectural Divergence from Feature 141**: Phase 3.5 produces an aggregate artifact (`attack-chains.md`) WITHOUT modifying the finding IR. Phase 3.6 modifies the finding IR in-place (write-back). Documented in ADR-026 with formal Governance Rule for Future Post-Hoc Synthesis Phases.

### Component 2: Shared Reference — Agentic Patterns

**Location**: `.claude/skills/tachi-shared/references/maestro-agentic-patterns-shared.md` (NEW)

**Content**: Six canonical pattern definitions (Section 1), coverage mapping table with Coverage Strength constrained to Full/Partial/None — Coverage Required (Section 2), classification rule table R-01 through R-06+ (Section 3), multi-agent gate predicate spec with worked examples on the 6 example architectures (Section 4), explicit component_type and topology indicator token lists (canonical finite enumerations).

**Consumed by**: Orchestrator Phase 3.6 synthesis, threat-report agent Agentic Pattern Analysis section narrative.

### Component 3: Finding Schema Extension

**Location**: `schemas/finding.yaml` (UPDATE; version 1.3 → 1.4)

**Schema change**: Adds `agentic_pattern` enum field (8 values: 6 canonical + `none` + `multiple`, default `none`). Also extends `id.pattern` regex to accept `AGP-` prefix for net-new generated findings.

**Versioning rationale (ADR-026)**: Minor bump 1.3 → 1.4 under the extended enum-typed-field-addition rule (additive + has default + shape unchanged).

### Component 4: threats.md Output Extension

**Location**: `templates/tachi/output-schemas/threats.md`

**Changes**: New Pattern column in Section 7 findings table (after Category, before Component); new conditional Section 4b "Findings by Agentic Pattern" rendered iff `has-agentic-patterns: true`.

### Component 5: Threat Report Agentic Pattern Analysis Section

**Location**: `.claude/agents/tachi/threat-report.md` + `.claude/skills/tachi-threat-reporting/references/narrative-templates.md`

**Design**: New conditional section "Agentic Pattern Analysis" placed after Cross-Layer Attack Chains (Feature 141), section number grep-determined at code time. Per pattern subsection: definition + severity counts + 100-200 word narrative + impacted finding IDs. Subsections ordered by max severity descending then finding count descending. Zero-finding subsections suppressed.

### Component 6: SARIF Pattern Tag Propagation

**Location**: `.claude/agents/tachi/orchestrator.md` (SARIF emission step extension)

**Design**: Per finding with non-`none` pattern, append `maestro-pattern:<pattern_name>` to `result.properties.tags`. Format matches existing `maestro-layer:<L#>` convention exactly (lowercase, colon-separator). Findings with `agentic_pattern: none` receive no pattern tag.

### Component 7: Example Architecture Extension (agentic-app)

**Location**: `examples/agentic-app/architecture.md`

**Path Decision**: Path 1 (extend agentic-app) selected. Adds Second LLM Agent (Specialist Agent), Long-running Learning Loop, Inter-agent Communication Channel. Surfaces ≥3 of the 6 canonical patterns end-to-end. 1-2h budget per PRD planned scope.

### Feature 189: Source Attribution Schema Extension (F-A2)

**PR**: [#190](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/pull/190) | **Status**: Delivered | **Date**: 2026-04-17 | **Squash-merge commit**: `6d5d890`

Additive schema extension introducing `source_attribution` as an optional list-of-RECORD field on findings. Schema version bumps 1.4 → 1.5 per [ADR-028](../02_ADRs/ADR-028-source-attribution-schema-extension.md) Decision 1 ("Complex-Shape Addition Clarifier" extending the ADR-026 minor-bump rule from scalar to list-of-RECORD fields). Contract-only: parser round-trip with conditional-key emission (Feature 104 `delta_status` precedent) and two-tier validation — parser-tier V1/V2/V3/V5 enum checks inline in `parse_threats_findings`, plus a new post-parse `validate_source_attribution` V4 referential-integrity helper invokable from orchestrator Phase 4 against the F-A1 catalog YAMLs. Populator wiring (threat agents emitting attribution records) is deferred to F-A3. No new runtime or developer dependencies. No edits to the 22-file zero-edit scope (11 threat-detection agents + 11 companion skill-reference files) per ADR-023. 36/36 tasks complete; triple sign-off.

### Feature 194: coverage-attestation-report-section

**PR**: [#195](https://github.com/davidmatousek/tachi/pull/195) | **Status**: Delivered | **Date**: 2026-04-18 | **Squash-merge commit**: `c4b8dc6` | **Position**: BLP-01 Tier 2 (F-B) — first downstream consumer of the F-A1 (Feature 180 taxonomy catalogs) + F-A2 (Feature 189 `source_attribution` contract) supply-side pair, consumed independently of the deferred F-A3 populator

Conditional PDF-only coverage-attestation section appended to the tachi security report, rendering (a) a single paginated per-finding attribution table (7 columns) and (b) one per-framework coverage matrix page per external framework in the F-A2 5-value taxonomy enum (OWASP, MITRE ATT&CK, MITRE ATLAS, NIST AI RMF, CWE). Gated on a single new `has-source-attribution` boolean in the Typst data contract — `true` iff ≥1 finding carries a non-empty `source_attribution` array; `false` on all 5 non-agentic baselines pre-F-A3, preserving SC-002 byte-identity under `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000` per ADR-021. Mirrors the Feature 141 `has-attack-chains` pattern verbatim (new Typst page + boolean emission + conditional `main.typ` block with default-value guard and `.len() > 0` belt-and-suspenders check) and the Feature 128 new-Typst-page precedent. New [ADR-029](../02_ADRs/ADR-029-coverage-attestation-report-section.md) under the Proposed → Accepted dual-commit pattern (Accepted 2026-04-18; provisional post-merge SHA fill task T044 pending). **45/46 tasks complete** with triple sign-off (PM + Architect + Team-Lead).

Consumes parsed findings from `parse_threats_findings` (F-A2 round-trip); classifies every top-level record in each framework YAML as Covered / Partial / Gap per Q1-A rule; emits per-finding rows + per-framework aggregates + `has-source-attribution` boolean.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Justification |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Aggregator | Python 3.11 + pyyaml (runtime, pre-existing) | Matches `extract-report-data.py` pattern; zero new runtime dep |
| Template | Typst (pre-existing) | Matches Feature 128 new-page + Feature 141 conditional-gate precedent |
| ADR | Markdown | Proposed → Accepted dual-commit per F-A1 (Feature 180) / F-A2 (Feature 189) precedent |
| Tests | pytest >= 8.0 (developer-only, pre-existing) | Established in Feature 128; SC-002 byte-identity harness reused unmodified |
| Determinism | `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000` per ADR-021 | 5 non-agentic baselines byte-identical (SC-002 BLOCKER gate) |
| Gate pattern | `has-source-attribution` + `.len() > 0` | Mirrors Feature 141 `has-attack-chains` dual-predicate (`main.typ:246`) |

**Architectural posture**: additive-only. Zero schema changes (FR-015 BLOCKER — `schemas/finding.yaml` remains at version 1.5 from Feature 189); zero edits to the 22-file scope (11 threat-detection agents + 11 companion skill-reference `detection-patterns.md` files) per ADR-023 / ADR-028 lineage (FR-014 / SC-009 BLOCKER — third extension of the invariant after F-082 / F-A2); no crosswalk JOIN (FR-017 scope boundary — `schemas/taxonomy/crosswalk.yaml` unused by F-B; deferred to F-C follow-on). Zero new runtime or developer dependencies (SC-008): empty diff on `requirements*.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json` (`pyyaml` already declared per Feature 128). F-A3 populator coordination handled via Day 2 EOD status check; F-A3 had not shipped at F-B merge time, so the `has-source-attribution` gate evaluates to `false` on all 5 non-agentic baselines, preserving byte-identity on `web-app`, `microservices`, `ascii-web-api`, `mermaid-agentic-app`, `free-text-microservice`, and `maestro-reference` (6-baseline coverage harness green).

**Strategic significance — BLP-01 Reporting tier unblocked**: F-B is the second of the 3-feature BLP-01 reporting initiative (F-A3 populators, F-B report section, F-C crosswalk-JOIN follow-on). F-B ships the consumer-side bridge — the PDF attestation renderer over the F-A1 / F-A2 data contract — independent of F-A3 populator completion. When F-A3 later wires threat-detection agents to emit `source_attribution` during detection, the `has-source-attribution` gate flips to `true` on affected architectures and the section renders automatically with no F-B code changes. Ecosystem integrators who consume tachi via the PDF surface now have a direct visual answer to the "what fraction of framework X does this engagement cover?" aggregate question, complementing the machine-readable access surface (`source_attribution` arrays on findings, Section 9 YAML block in `threats.md`) shipped by F-A2.
