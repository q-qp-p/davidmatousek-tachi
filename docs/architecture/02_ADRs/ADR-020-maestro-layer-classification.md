# ADR-020: MAESTRO Layer Classification for Threat Findings

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-04-08
**Deciders**: Architect
**Feature**: 084 (MAESTRO Layer Mapping)

---

## Context

tachi's threat model pipeline classifies components by DFD element type (External Entity, Process, Data Store, Data Flow) during Phase 1 (Scope), then dispatches STRIDE and AI threat agents accordingly. However, the pipeline had no awareness of where components sit within an agentic AI architecture stack. This limited the ability to:

1. **Identify architectural concentration risk**: Threats clustered at one layer (e.g., many threats against Foundation Model components) were invisible without manual review.
2. **Align with industry taxonomy**: Security teams using CSA's MAESTRO framework could not map tachi findings to their existing layer-based security controls.
3. **Enable layer-based risk aggregation**: The Risk Summary section could not break down findings by architectural layer, making it harder to prioritize remediation across system tiers.

**Constraints**:
- Classification must not require user-provided layer annotations -- it must be automatic.
- Classification must be deterministic and auditable (no LLM-based classification of component types).
- The new field must propagate through the entire pipeline without breaking existing consumers.
- Classification must handle components that do not fit any layer gracefully (no errors for unclassifiable components).

## Decision

We will adopt the **CSA MAESTRO seven-layer taxonomy** as the architectural layer classification framework, implemented via **keyword-based substring matching** during Phase 1 with ordered evaluation (L1 through L7, first match wins).

The implementation adds:
1. A shared reference file (`maestro-layers-shared.md`) with the canonical keyword-to-layer mapping table.
2. An optional `maestro_layer` field on the finding IR schema (`schemas/finding.yaml`, schema_version 1.1 to 1.2).
3. Phase 1 classification: after DFD type assignment, each component is classified by matching its name, description, and DFD type against layer keywords.
4. Phase 3 inheritance: each finding inherits `maestro_layer` from its target component.
5. Passive propagation through downstream agents (risk-scorer, control-analyzer, threat-report).

## Rationale

**Reasons**:
1. **Industry alignment**: CSA MAESTRO is the only published seven-layer taxonomy specifically designed for agentic AI architectures. Using it provides a shared vocabulary with the broader security community.
2. **Keyword matching reuses proven pattern**: The AI dispatch mechanism (Feature 007) already uses case-insensitive keyword matching to classify components. MAESTRO classification follows the same pattern, reducing implementation risk.
3. **Deterministic and auditable**: Keyword matching produces the same result every run for the same input, unlike LLM-based classification which could vary between invocations. The keyword table is inspectable and versioned.
4. **Non-breaking schema extension**: The `maestro_layer` field defaults to "Unclassified", making it backward-compatible with existing threat models and consumers that do not use it.
5. **Shared reference prevents drift**: Following ADR-019 (shared definitions), the keyword table lives in `tachi-shared` as a single source of truth consumed by all agents that need layer awareness.

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: LLM-Based Component Classification
**Pros**:
- Could handle ambiguous component names more intelligently
- No keyword table maintenance

**Cons**:
- Non-deterministic: same component could be classified differently across runs
- Not auditable: no inspectable mapping table
- Adds inference cost and latency to Phase 1
- Conflicts with tachi's deterministic pipeline design principle

**Why Not Chosen**: Determinism and auditability are critical for security tooling. Keyword matching provides both while handling the vast majority of real-world component names correctly.

### Alternative 2: User-Provided Layer Annotations
**Pros**:
- Most accurate classification possible
- No false positives from keyword matching

**Cons**:
- Adds mandatory input burden on every threat model run
- Breaks the current zero-configuration input contract
- Users unfamiliar with MAESTRO would produce inaccurate annotations

**Why Not Chosen**: Automatic classification with graceful fallback ("Unclassified") delivers value without requiring users to learn a new taxonomy.

### Alternative 3: Custom Layer Taxonomy
**Pros**:
- Could be tailored exactly to tachi's needs
- No dependency on external framework updates

**Cons**:
- Reinvents an existing standard without adding value
- No shared vocabulary with the security community
- Additional maintenance burden to keep custom taxonomy current

**Why Not Chosen**: CSA MAESTRO is well-aligned with tachi's target domain (agentic AI). A custom taxonomy would duplicate effort without meaningful benefit.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Threat models now include architectural layer context for every component and finding
- Risk Summary includes a "Risk by MAESTRO Layer" breakdown enabling layer-based prioritization
- SARIF output tags findings with MAESTRO layer for downstream tooling integration
- Aligns tachi with CSA's industry-standard framework for agentic AI security

### Negative
- Keyword matching can misclassify components with ambiguous names (e.g., "API Gateway" could be L4 or L7)
- Evaluation order (L1-L7) is load-bearing -- reordering keywords changes classification
- Adding new layers or modifying keywords requires regression testing against all example outputs

### Mitigation
- Evaluation order follows a specificity gradient (most specific first) to minimize ambiguity
- "Unclassified" default ensures graceful degradation for unrecognized components
- All 6 example outputs were regenerated and validated after implementation
- Keyword table changes are documented with a warning about ordering sensitivity
