# ADR-014: Gemini API Optional Image Generation with Graceful Degradation

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-03-23
**Deciders**: Architect
**Feature**: 018 (Threat Infographic Agent)

---

## Context

Feature 018 adds a threat infographic agent to the orchestrator pipeline as Phase 6. The agent transforms structured threat model findings (`threats.md`) into a visual risk specification (`threat-infographic-spec.md`) containing 6 sections: Metadata, Risk Distribution, Coverage Heat Map, Top Critical Findings, Architecture Threat Overlay, and Visual Design Directives.

The specification is a self-contained document that a designer can render into a visual infographic. However, for immediate value and executive presentation scenarios, the feature also supports automated image generation from the specification.

Two architectural decisions are required:

1. **External API introduction**: The tachi pipeline has been entirely self-contained (no external service dependencies) through Features 001-015. Image generation requires an external API. Which API, and how should the dependency be managed?

2. **Spec-first vs. image-first design**: Should the image be the primary deliverable (with the spec as an intermediate artifact), or should the specification be the primary deliverable (with the image as an enhancement)?

3. **Opt-out mechanism**: Phase 6 follows the default-on pattern established in Phase 5 (Feature 015) and ADR-008/ADR-011. How should opt-out work given the additional complexity of an external API dependency?

---

## Decision

### 1. Spec-First Architecture

The infographic specification (`threat-infographic-spec.md`) is the **primary deliverable**. The image (`threat-infographic.jpg`) is an **optional best-effort enhancement**. The specification is always produced when Phase 6 runs. The image is produced only when the Gemini API key is available and the API call succeeds.

This is the **spec-first pattern**: the pipeline always produces a complete, validated, human-readable specification regardless of external service availability. The image generation is a downstream enhancement that consumes the specification.

### 2. Google Gemini API for Image Generation

We will use the **Google Gemini API** (`gemini-3-pro-image-preview` model, with `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` as fallback) for image generation. Authentication is via the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable.

### 3. Six-Condition Graceful Degradation

The infographic agent handles six specific error conditions, all with the same outcome: the specification is preserved as a standalone deliverable, and the pipeline is never blocked.

| Condition | Spec Saved | Image Generated | Pipeline Blocked |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Missing API key | Yes | No | No |
| Rate limit (429) | Yes | No | No |
| API timeout (60s) | Yes | No | No |
| Content policy rejection | Yes | No | No |
| Missing Section 6 in input | Yes (computed) | Attempted | No |
| Empty threat model | Yes (zero-count) | No | No |

### 4. Triple Opt-Out Mechanism

Phase 6 supports three independent opt-out mechanisms following the pattern established in ADR-008 and extended in ADR-011:

1. **Flag**: `--skip-infographic` -- command-line flag for per-invocation control
2. **Environment variable**: `TACHI_SKIP_INFOGRAPHIC=true` -- for CI/CD pipeline configuration
3. **Configuration**: `infographic: false` -- for persistent project-level configuration

The environment variable mechanism is new to tachi (Phase 5 used only flag and config). It was added because CI/CD pipelines that do not have Gemini API keys should be able to skip Phase 6 cleanly without modifying invocation flags.

## Rationale

### Why spec-first (not image-first)?

1. **Reliability**: The specification can be produced with zero external dependencies. Making the image the primary deliverable would make the pipeline's usefulness contingent on an external API -- violating tachi's local-first, dependency-free philosophy.

2. **Debuggability**: When the image does not match expectations, the specification provides a clear audit trail of exactly what data was extracted and what visual instructions were given. An image-first design would be a black box.

3. **Flexibility**: The specification is consumable by human designers, other image generation tools, and future rendering pipelines. An image-first design locks the output to a single rendering technology.

4. **Consistency**: The specification follows the same markdown-with-YAML-frontmatter pattern as every other tachi output (`threats.md`, `threat-report.md`, `threats.sarif`). The image is a rendering of the specification, not a replacement for it.

### Why Gemini API (not alternatives)?

1. **Text rendering quality**: Gemini's image generation models produce superior text rendering for data-dense infographics compared to alternatives tested during design. Data labels, severity counts, and finding summaries require legible text in the generated image.

2. **Structured prompt support**: Gemini accepts narrative scene descriptions with explicit spatial placement instructions and hex color codes, which maps directly to the specification's Visual Design Directives section.

3. **Single API call**: The entire infographic can be generated in one API call with a text prompt. No multi-step workflow, no image composition pipeline, no intermediate artifacts.

### Why graceful degradation (not hard failure)?

1. **Pipeline integrity**: Phases 1-5 represent the core threat modeling value. Phase 6 is a presentation enhancement. A failure in image generation should never invalidate the security analysis.

2. **API unreliability**: External APIs are subject to rate limits, content policy changes, model deprecation, and network failures. Designing for graceful degradation from the start prevents future reliability issues from becoming pipeline failures.

3. **Zero-config usability**: Users who do not have a Gemini API key still get the infographic specification. The feature is useful without any external service configuration.

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: No Image Generation (Spec Only)

**Pros**:
- Zero external dependencies
- Simpler implementation
- No API key management

**Cons**:
- Reduces immediate value for executive audiences who want a visual artifact
- Misses the opportunity to demonstrate end-to-end automated visualization

**Why Not Chosen**: The spec-first architecture provides the zero-dependency benefit while still offering image generation as an enhancement. Users who want spec-only get it by default (no API key needed).

### Alternative 2: Mermaid Diagram Instead of Image

**Pros**:
- No external API dependency
- GitHub-renderable (consistent with attack trees in Feature 015)
- Text-based, version-controllable

**Cons**:
- Mermaid cannot produce presentation-quality infographics (no custom color palettes, no spatial zone layouts, no typography control)
- Infographic requirements (donut charts, heat maps, three-zone layouts) exceed Mermaid's diagramming capabilities
- Would produce a diagram, not an infographic -- different deliverable type

**Why Not Chosen**: Mermaid is appropriate for technical diagrams (attack trees) but cannot produce the data-dense, design-controlled visual format that executive audiences expect from a risk infographic.

### Alternative 3: DALL-E or Stable Diffusion for Image Generation

**Pros**:
- DALL-E: Widely known, OpenAI ecosystem
- Stable Diffusion: Open-source, self-hostable

**Cons**:
- DALL-E: Inferior text rendering in images; data labels and counts would be illegible
- Stable Diffusion: Requires GPU infrastructure; self-hosting violates local-first simplicity
- Both: Less controllable spatial placement than Gemini for structured data visualization

**Why Not Chosen**: Text rendering quality is the primary selection criterion for data-dense infographics. Gemini's image generation produces more legible text labels and data values than alternatives tested.

### Alternative 4: Mandatory API Key (Hard Failure Without Key)

**Pros**:
- Simpler error handling
- Guarantees image output when Phase 6 runs

**Cons**:
- Blocks the pipeline for users without a Gemini account
- Violates tachi's local-first, zero-external-dependency philosophy
- Makes Phase 6 unusable in CI/CD environments without API key secrets configured

**Why Not Chosen**: The spec-first design provides value without any API key. Making the key mandatory would reduce adoption and violate the graceful degradation principle.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Phase 6 produces a validated specification with zero external dependencies
- Image generation is a transparent enhancement -- users see exactly what data drives the image
- Six-condition graceful degradation ensures the pipeline never fails due to an external API
- Triple opt-out (flag, env var, config) covers all skip scenarios including CI/CD
- Establishes the spec-first pattern for future features that may integrate external services

### Negative
- First external API dependency in the tachi pipeline (Gemini API)
- Image quality depends on Gemini model capabilities which may change across model versions
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` is a new environment variable that users must manage if they want image generation
- Content policy rejections from Gemini are possible despite business-oriented prompt framing

### Mitigation
- External dependency is entirely optional -- spec is always produced without it
- Fallback model (`gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview`) provides resilience against primary model deprecation
- Prompt construction uses business-oriented language (avoiding attack terminology) to minimize content policy rejections
- API key absence produces an informational log message with setup guidance, not an error
